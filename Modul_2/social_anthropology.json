         "description" : "This book combines the interdisciplinary insights of history, anthropology, and computing to examine the interrelationships between politics, kinship, and marriage in a late-medieval city-state. At the heart of the study is a reconsideration of `office' and the ways in which ties of kinshipand marriage were mobilized to build electoral success. In fifteenth-century Ragusa (present-day Dubrovnik) membership of the Great Council, which nominated and elected office-holders, was restricted to the legitimate male offspring of patrician brides and grooms. The patrician class was highlyendogamous, and the relationship between endogamy and electoral support is an important theme running through this book. A related theme concerns the age differences between spouses, which are shown to have important structural implications for the organization of the casata, kinship relations, andmarriage ties. These implications are investigated using a variety of innovative methods, including cohort analysis and computer simulation.",

He has asserted that the words used appear to imply that human social behavior is somehow not natural. But of course it is. Exploring how and why is Tiger's central adventure. As a teacher, writer of books and articles which have been widely published and translated and as co-Research Director of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, he has been an influential figure in broadening our knowledge about why we do what we do.",

Applying insights from sociology, artificial intelligence, engineering, and anthropology, Rheingold offers a penetrating perspective on this brave new convergence of pop culture, cutting-edge technology, and social activism, and at the same time, emphasizes that the real impact of mobile communications will come not from the technology itself but from how people use it.

Such reviews should include conceptualizations, interpretations, and syntheses of literature and scholarly work in a field broadly relevant to education and educational research. RER encourages the submission of research relevant to education from any discipline, such as reviews of research in psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, political science, economics, computer science, statistics, anthropology, and biology, provided that the review bears on educational issues. RER does not publish original empirical research unless it is incorporated in a broader integrative review. RER will occasionally publish solicited, but carefully refereed, analytic reviews of special topics, particularly from disciplines infrequently represented.",

Each entry contains cross references and a bibliographic guide to further reading. The Encyclopedia also contains a biographic appendix, with details of the lives and works of over 200 important figures in the history of anthropology and a glossary with short explanations of over 500 terms and concepts. Areas covered include: History of anthropological research, colonialism, orientalism and occidentalism, theories of culture and society * Kinship, gender and family, marriage, the body * Ritual and religion, language and linguistics, poetics, literacy, aesthetics, film, museums * Relations with other disciplines (e.g. archaeology and sociology).",

Social theory has had to grapple with the varieties of human experience reported by ethnographers; and out of their ethnographic experience, social anthropologists have constructed unique theoretical insights. The contributors to this volume, leading figures in European social anthropology today, reanimate this great tradition. They confront the models current in the social sciences with the diverse, often exotic, experiences and models of their subjects.\" \"But if the broad project is accepted, theoretical strategies are the subject of urgent debate. The authors in this volume advocate diverse approaches to social theory, ranging from the action-based models of network theorists through the subtleties of the neo-structuralists to the daring experiments of the new cognitivists. Their lively debates refer to fascinating case studies, drawn from wide ethnographic experience.\" \"Conceptualizing Society represents a significant contribution to social theory. It will be required reading for all social anthropologists, and for all those whose concern with social theory transcends the most parochial span.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

It is addressed in particular to students of anthropology, but is also intended as a one-volume guide to those, such as social historians and geographers, who find it necessary to understand patterns of kinship in different places and at different times. The book is divided into two parts. It opens with a discussion of what kinship means to the social anthropologist as distinct from the biologist, and considers the different possible approaches to the subject within social anthropology itself. The following chapters cover topics such as descent, inheritance, succession, the family, residence, marriage, kinship terminology, systems and pseudo-systems of affinal alliance, the new reproductive technologies, and symbolic approaches to kinship. In Part II four chapters provide an overview of theoretical debates concerning aspects of kinship, and consider, for example, how recent work on gender, person, and the body have challenged and modified earlier assumptions about, for example, descent, succession, and familial alliances. The book applies and illustrates these concepts and topics to a number of contrasting case studies. These illustrate the insights that can be achieved from the study of kinship, and also show that the complexity of even the most familiar kinship patterns rarely lends itself to simple description. The author also includes annotated guides to further reading.",

Are culture, society and similar\n\tconcepts from anthropology and sociology of any real use in making\n\tsense of human social life? How can we understand the relationship\n\tbetween the social group and the individual human beings, with their\n\tself-awareness and sense of personal identity, who make it up? Drawing\n\ton his background in physics, Dr Samuel suggests a scientific approach\n\tinvolving a reconceptualization of many of the concepts we take for\n\tgranted. The multimodal framework, or MMF, derives from this approach.\n\tIt incorporates many of the insights of social and cultural anthropology,\n\tparticularly the work of Gregory Bateson and Victor Turner, as well\n\tas being influenced by recent developments in the philosophy of science\n\tand related fields. Finally, the book considers some of the implications\n\tof the MMF for biological approaches, and focuses on questions of\n\tbrain structure and on evolutionary explanations for human social\n\tbehaviour.",

But developments in anthropology, history, communication, American studies, and literary criticism have given the study of popular culture new analytic tools and legitimacy. This article reviews some of the more noteworthy contributions to this body of scholarship. Interpretive anthropology by Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, and others, historical work influenced by the Annales school, studies of mass media, and the work of structuralists and post-structuralists from many disciplines are all discussed. This work, as well as sociological analyses of leisure, art, and mass culture are shown to have provided rich and vital insights into the social power and forms of popular culture.",

Articles in journals were the predominant outlet in all disciplines. Monographs and popularizing articles were more important outlets in lsquosofterrsquo fields than in lsquoharderrsquo ones. The enlightenment function of scholarship was especially evident in Dutch literature and language, and public administration. Only some of the humanities disciplines are locally oriented. Although many publications were written in English, only experimental psychology, general linguistics, anthropology, and genrral literature were internationally oriented regarding output media. The impact of departments differed greatly both within and between disciplines. For all disciplines, bibliometric indicators are potentially useful for monitoring international impact, as expert interviews confirmed. Especially in Dutch language, Dutch literature and public administration, ISI-citation data are not very useful for monitoring national impact.",

However, there is little systematic analysis in the literature that explains the way social capital aids in fostering collective action. The paper integrates ideas from institutional ecological economics, sociology and anthropology to argue that power relations, involving struggle and resistance, should be acknowledged as they affect collective action. We address the question of why social capital should not be straightforwardly associated positively with common property resource management. To unravel the complexity of the links between social capital, collective action and common property resource management, the concepts of common knowledge and symbolic power are introduced.",

As societies and economies in many parts of the world are faced with dramatic changes as a result of advances in computing power and software development, changes that are directly affecting translation itself, it is argued that responses to the technologisation of food production are instructive for the future direction of translation both as a profession and as a domain of research. More specifically, analysing dimensions to the practice of food translation points up the emergence of a political ecology of translation. These dimensions include translational productivity, the role of the local or place and the fractal properties of language in translation. This emergent ecology draws on key concepts from social anthropology such as ?wayfaring? and ?meshwork? to reconceptualise the potential agency of the translator in what is increasingly referred to as the Second Machine Age. A crucial component of this new ecology of translation is an attention to inter-species communication and how the translation paradigm is an inescapable part of human?animal relationships.",

Central to this debate is the notion that disciplines differ in the ways in which they exchange ideas and disseminate information and therefore have diverse publishing and citation patterns. In this article we use two different approaches to compiling bibliometric data to compare publishing patterns of five different disciplines that encompass Molecular Biology, Administration/Political Science, Psychology, Philosophy and Sociology/Anthropology. We find that the social sciences differ from each other as well as from the physical sciences in their publication and citation patterns. Further, while the different ways of organizing the data produce somewhat different results, the substantive findings for the general patterning of publications and citations of disciplines are consistent for both data sets. Sociology/Anthropology, when compared with the other disciplines, shows substantial differences across universities.",

Social theorists, historians, literary researchers, folklorists, and scholars in science and technology studies and visual, performative, and cultural studies provide a range of substantively rich accounts and epistemologically provocative models for how researchers can take sound seriously. This conversation explores general outlines of an anthropology of sound. Its main focus, however, is on the issues involved in using sound as a primary medium for ethnographic research.",

This exploration reveals how the highest good of a possible world roots Kant's moral philosophy in human nature, history, and social experience; how Kant's interest in individual freedom shapes and illuminates his conceptions of human perfection and human flourishing; and how Kantian ethics provides resources for thinking about the meaning and purpose of human life.",

While Christian sacred topography is usually interpreted in narrowly religious terms as points of contact with holy places and people, this book considers church buildings as spatial environments in which a range of social \u2018work\u2019 happened. It draws on approaches developed in the fields of anthropology, ritual studies, and social geography to examine, for example, how church buildings facilitated commemoration of the community's dead, establishment of a shared historical past, and communication with the divine. Surveying evidence for the introduction of saints into liturgical performance and the architectural and decorative programs of churches, this analysis explains how saints helped to bolster the boundaries of church space, reinforce local social and religious hierarchies, and negotiate the community's place within larger regional and cosmic networks.",

The literature review of this new anthropology provides the main academic works that have been published vis-Ã Ëa-vis the Theravada Buddhism, animism, and supernaturalism. Scams have been added to this academic paper as they are based on the former, and scams in late modernity have emerged and evolved from the new anthropology. It is a new anthropology for the following three main reasons: (1) it adopts a modern approach to understanding such cultural, social, and traditional phenomena; (2) the method involves both normative and quantitative methods used in the social and political sciences; and (3) a more objective and scientific approach is adopted in the new political tropology because of the uneven distribution of power in these cultural and social phenomena. Individuals actually have a choice to avoid being scammed. Yet, millions of people seem to prefer to be duped. People keep losing billions of dollars to scammers. Why is this so? This study seeks to explain this social phenomenon. Think of the word \u201Cscam\u201D and what comes to mind is a wide range of scams targeting old people\u2019s life savings; insecure women in Singapore seeking romance and erotic love from Turkish men; poor Turkish men in Singapore living off their Singaporean girlfriends and wives (they usually have one of each simultaneously); financial scams by lawyers and foreigners in Thailand; phishing scams in Malaysia; as well as gambling scams and online scams in Singapore. Millions continue to be lost in scams involving fake government agencies, including Singapore\u2019s Income Tax Agency and Singapore\u2019s CPF Board. While legitimate governments spend billions of dollars on countermeasures to combat these nefarious tricksters, there appears to be little to nothing that is achieved. People are very easily misled. This study focused on multimillion-dollar scammers who prey on individuals who believe in magic, ritual, occult, tradition, religion, and superstition. Ignoramuses, the mentally retarded, and simpletons are often superstitious; they are the most likely to fall for scams. Scams take place in crowded places with a high walk-in, street-level crowd, and the profits range from a few cents to thousands of dollars a second. This study concludes with a clear solution to the problems associated with superstition and scams in Southeast Asia. There is a politics to Asian scams because of the uneven distribution of power among those who believe in superstitions, animism, and religions; it is a paradox that makes many people vulnerable to being scammed.",

It is both a methodological tool and a theoretical paradigm that allows us to pose and answer important ecological questions in public health. In this review we trace the history of network analysis, provide a methodological overview of network techniques, and discuss where and how network analysis has been used in public health. We show how network analysis has its roots in mathematics, statistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, physics, and computer science. In public health, network analysis has been used to study primarily disease transmission, especially for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; information transmission, particularly for diffusion of innovations; the role of social support and social capital; the influence of personal and social networks on health behavior; and the interorganizational structure of health systems. We conclude with future directions for network analysis in public health.",

These case studies, ranging from Taiwan to South Texas, build upon an original joining of anthropology, critical education theory, and cultural studies. The studies advance the concept of cultural production as a way of understanding the dynamics of power and identity formation underlying different forms of \"education.\" Using the concept of the \"educated person\" as a culture-specific construct, the authors examine conflicts and points of convergence between cultural practices and knowledges that are produced in and out of schools.",

Les raisons d'agir des communicateurs autochtones, au dqpart caractqrisqes par un simple altruisme, ont qvoluq vers un besoin urgent de tqmoigner des torts, prqsents et passqs, perpqtrqs contre eux par divers agents de la sociqtq dominante. Les motifs des sciences humaines sont qgalement complexes. La plupart d'entre elles, et l'anthropologie en particulier, font appel a la traduction. Les thqories de la traduction de l'anthropologie trahissent un malaise gqnqral envers ses pratiques et ses motifs traductifs. La traduction anthropologique diffFre de celle des autres disciplines du fait que lorsque les anthropologues traduisent des Â½ textes + oraux et qcrits, leur but ultime est en fait la Â½ traduction + des cultures qui les ont produits.This article inquires into the motives of the participants in the recording, transcribing, translating, editing and publishing of Aboriginal narrative. The motivation of Aboriginal communicators, at the outset simple altruism, has evolved onto a pressing need to bear witness to past and present wrongs perpetrated against them by various agents of the dominant society. Social scientists' motivations are equally complex. Most of the social sciences, and particularly anthropology, practice translation. Anthropology has elaborated translation theories that betray a general unease with how and why anthropologists translate. Anthropological translation differs from that of other disciplines in that when anthropologists translate oral and written 'texts,' their ultimate aim is in fact the 'translation' of the cultures that produced them.",

Focussing on Tarde's political writings, this article seeks to counter this prevalent vision of Tarde as a thinker of molecular social processes who provides us with the tools to think beyond the parameters of sovereignty and to embrace a transnational understanding of social change. Tarde's thinking of politics is analysed in terms of its reliance on a political anthropology of obedience, its ambivalent attitude towards the democratization of the political sphere, its image of the state as an enabler and filter of inventions, and its attempts to articulate the relation between the social and the political. By means of the notion of 'empowering pacification', the article concludes that the significance of Tarde for the present lies in his contradictory and symptomatic conceptualization of the persistence of political power and institutional centralization in the midst of a tendency towards the global expansion of the field of social interactions, as well as in his strategic attempt to imagine forms of power that would neutralize the possibility of social turmoil and class conflict.",

It is suggested that innovations of different kinds find readiest adoption among individuals in different positions of the social structure. Notions drawn from the sociology of change, group dynamics, rural sociology, cultural anthropology, and decision analysis form the basis for a more specific set of hypotheses, which invoke \"emancipation-conformity,\" \"communication,\" and Ã¤ssurance\" as mechanisms that intervene between social position and the acceptance of an innovation. Predictions derived from the hypotheses are tested by an examination of several forms of innovation-accepting behavior on the part of the physicians originally described. While the test proves far from adequate, it permits the conclusion that the hypothetical scheme, at least in broad outline, is a fruitful starting point for further research.",

One of the areas anthropologists can contribute to here is to rethink the notion of social context where technology is used. Context is usually equated with the immediate activities such as work tasks, when and by whom the task is performed. This tends to under represent some fundamental aspects of social life, like culture and history. In this paper, we want to open up a discussion about what context means in HCI and to emphasize socio-structural and historical aspects of the term. We will suggest a more inclusive analytic way that able the HCI community to make \"better\" sense of use situation. An example of technology use in a workplace will be given to demonstrate the yields this kind of theoretical framework can bring into HCI.",

Seawater as culture manifests as a medium of pleasure, sustenance, travel, disaster. I argue that, although seawater's qualities in early anthropology were portrayed impressionistically, today technical, scientific descriptions of water's form prevail. For example, processes of globalization\u2014which may also be called \u201Coceanization\u201D\u2014are often described as \u201Ccurrents,\u201D\u201Cflows,\u201D and \u201Ccirculations.\u201D Examining sea-set ethnography, maritime anthropologies, and contemporary social theory, I propose that seawater has operated as a \u201Ctheory machine\u201D for generating insights about human cultural organization. I develop this argument with ethnography from the Sargasso Sea and in the Sea Islands. I conclude with a critique of appeals to water's form in social theory.",

In particular, a line of critical thought that traces its origins to a Husserlian critique of rationality remains as relevant and resonant as ever. In order to demonstrate how this is so, a reconceptualisation of the notion of production in social anthropology is linked to the historical practice of translation to argue for the severe limitations of forms of political thought and cultural practice based on a notion of the transitive. This paradigm of transitivity is then related to forms of instrumentality that underlie the extension of neo-liberal economic rationale to all forms of social existence. It is only through the convergence of critical thinking across Europe, both from the present and the recent past, that Europe can be saved from market capture and populist repudiation.",

         "abstract": "In this innovative approach to the practice of social science, Charles Ragin explores the use of fuzzy sets to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative methods. Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, \"fuzzy\" instrument (the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other) with a precise one (degree of membership in a well-defined set). Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon \"homogenizing assumptions\" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book should revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.",

It presents original research and integrates historical methodologies with those of anthropology, geography, literature, art, and architecture. Moving between precolonial, colonial, and contemporary urban spaces, it covers the major regions, religions, and cultural influences of sub-Saharan Africa. The themes include Islam and Christianity, architecture, migration, globalization, social and physical decay, identity, race relations, politics, and development. This book elaborates on not only what makes the study of African urban spaces unique within urban historiography, it also offers an encompassing and up-to-date study of the subject and inserts Africa into the growing debate on urban history and culture throughout the world.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

This study uses citation analysis as a tool to select books for the social science book collection in one academic library and compares the circulation of books using traditional methods to those books using citation analysis. The journal impact factor was used to determine those journals and authors cited the most in the disciplines of business, anthropology, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. If those authors published books, the books were purchased and circulation data on the books were tabulated and compared to books chosen using traditional methods. Findings indicate that books purchased using traditional methods of selection circulated more, except when individual disciplines were measured. In the areas of business, political science, and psychology, there was no significant difference in circulation statistics, and together both the traditional and citation analysis methods accounted for circulation of nearly 95% of the social science collection. Since it is based on scholarly activity, citation analysis is a collection development method that could be used in all academic libraries.",

This provokes many a criticism and misunderstanding. Such a theory may not correspond with the model of social psychology as it is defined at present. One attempts however to show that it answers important social and scientific questions, in what it differs from the classical conception of collective representations and, from the very beginning, adopts a constructivist perspective which has spread in social psychology since. Several trends of research have confirmed its vision of the relations between social and cognitive phenomena, communication and thought. More detailed remarks aim at outlining the nature of social representations, their capacity to create information, their function which is to familiarize us with the strange, according to the categories of our culture. Going farther, one insists on the diversity of methodological approaches. If the experimental method is useful to understand how people should think, higher mental and social processes must be approached by different methods, including linguistic analysis and observation of how people think. No doubt, social representations have a relation with the more recent field of social cognition. But inasmuch as the former depend on content and context, i.e. subjectivity and sociability of people, they approach the phenomena differently from the latter. Referring to child psychology and anthropology, one can contend, despite appearances, that it is also a more scientific approach. There is however much to be learned from criticisms and there is still a long way to go before we arrive at a satisfactory theory of social thinking and communication.",

Topics include the definition of a 'case study,' the strengths and weaknesses of this distinctive method, strategies for choosing cases, an experimental template for understanding research design, and the role of singular observations in case study research.

Following an anthropology of policy approach, the article provides insights into both the conditions of refugees in Italy and the relationships which exist between the political Left and the 'new' immigrations. This is done by showing how the discourses and the practices of the Left can be oppressive and how such oppression is not merely due to an inescapable macro-structural order of things but has local 'origins', too. Thus it is argued that if social justice is still a priority in the political agenda of the mainstream Left in Italy, as is claimed, then the Left has some rethinking to do in order to avoid its entanglement and responsibility in processes of oppression and domination in the context of migration.",

Data about publication patterns in leading journals document this situation as well as a variance in theoretical orientations. IR is conducted differently in different places. The main patterns are explained through a sociology of science model that emphasizes the different nine- teen th-century histories of the state, the early format of social science, and the institutionalized delineation among the different social sciences. The internal social and intellectual structure of American IR is two-tiered, with relatively independent subfields and a top layer defined by access to the leading journals (on which IR, in contrast to some social sciences, has a high consensus). The famous successive 'great debates' serve an important function by letting lead theorists focus and structure the whole discipline. IR in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom has historically been structured differently, often with power vested more locally. American IR now moves in a direction that undermines its global hegemony. The widespread turn to rational choice privileges a reintegration (and status-wise rehabilitation) with the rest of political science over attention to JR practices elsewhere. This rationalistic turn is alien to Europeans, both because their IR is generally closer to sociology, philosophy, and anthropology, and because the liberal ontological premises of rational choice are less fitting to European societies. Simultaneously, European IR is beginning to break the local power bastions and establish independent research communities at a national or, increasingly, a European level. As American IR turns from global hegemony to national professionalization, IR becomes more pluralistic.",

Based on the so-called double periphery \u2013 the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology \u2013 the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina's last dictatorship (1976\u20131983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field's sociological aspects as it moves along this path.",

This article reviews work published since DiMaggio's agenda-setting piece\u2014research that builds on cross-disciplinary links between cultural sociology and the cognitive sciences.

This then leads to a particular patterning of neuronal processes that may be detected using\r\ne.g. brain imaging methods.

We then discuss these findings in the\r\nlight of predictive models of brain function.

This article argues that an escape from the nihilistic excesses of deconstructionism is possible if ethnicity is `re-located' from the narrow space it inhabits in current theories (social, cultural or psychological) to the active interface between the mind, society and culture. Two bodies of case material (from urban Papua New Guinea and New Zealand) are presented here in an attempt to demonstrate that, firstly, ethnicity is the product of an empirically available activity, classifying people according to their origins, and secondly a great deal of cultural and symbolic content accretes to these classifications. When ethnicity becomes subject to the elaborations of cultural or identity politics it often develops into a focus of symbolic contestation. The symbolic and ideological elaborations of ethnicity present analysts with phenomena analytically separate from ethnic classification itself",

In search of a theoretical framework that accounts for the social roles and cultural identities of the community interpreter I began to re-read the German anthropologist and conference interpreter Heinz GÃ¶hring. His articles can be positioned between German Studies (\u2018Deutsch als Fremdsprache\u2018), intercultural communication studies (including cultural anthropology) and translation studies. I start out with his view of an ideal translator/ interpreter as cultural expert acting like a \u201Cmini-ethnographer\u201D and try to go beyond GÃ¶hring by connecting his ideas to the concept of the critical ethnographer as model for a professional community interpreter. In this theoretical discussion I want to show how a synthesis of the framework proposed by GÃ¶hring and recent anthropological theories can be used for a new professional profile of the interpreter, not only in community settings but in general. Besides aspects concerning translation/ interpreting politics, I wish to foreground that a re-thinking of interpreter roles would/ should also affect translation/ interpreting pedagogy and research",

         "abstract": "Ãs the famous sociologist Fei Xiaotong argued, \u201Cthe real life of most Chinese can only be seen in the villages.\u201D Peasants not only comprise a significant part of the Chinese population but represent a distinctive culture and one that is expressed in its own particular way. This makes for an important area of study for scholars in communication studies.\r\nThis volume investigates how Chinese peasants express their culture and adapt to social change. The author\u2019s research consists of participant observation and interviews of shadow puppetry artists in Guanzhong, China, illustrating how peasant artists have adapted to the historical and social changes since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. He discovers that Chinese peasants integrate urban popular culture with their own aesthetic criteria, even if the mainstream discourse of the Chinese community overlooks the subjectivity of peasants. He goes on to put forwards a creative analytical framework for the studies of the dynamics of \u201Csubject-time-space.\u201D\r\nScholars and students of anthropology, sociology, and communication studies, especially rural communication studies, will find this an ideal case study.\" (https://www.routledge.com/Cultural-Expression-and-Subjectivity-of-Chinese-Peasants/Yao/p/book/9781032039312)",

This article extends the existing literature by providing a finer grained understanding of key influences in tourism research. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of the tourism literature by examining papers authored by Australian and New Zealand researchers in Annals of Tourism Research and Tourism Management between 1994 and 2007. A general picture of the field is drawn by examining keywords, the most-cited authors and works, as well as co-citation patterns. The analysis is extended by the use of social network analysis to explore the links between keywords and influential works in the field. The article also addresses the conference theme by identifying emerging themes and influences. Results indicate that tourism research in Australia and New Zealand has been strongly influenced by sociology and anthropology, geography and behavioural psychology. Emerging themes have focused on the health and safety of tourists, risk, wine tourism and segmentation.",

Does the ability to choose from such a wide range of commodities give us more satisfaction? Why do we accept being pushed into buying products about which we know little because they promise to give us a particular characteristic - freshness, happiness, sex appeal?\tConsumerism and capitalist and socialist industry have reached the point where state power is legitimatized by its ability to increase the number of commodities. A unique culture has been created in which marketing is the main social bond. Values no longer shape and condition needs, wants, desires, or preferences. Leiss draws on economics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology to show the vagueness of our thought on the relation between nature and culture, desire and reason, needs and commodities. This book raises serious, vital questions for all those concerned about the future of our present society.",

Drawing from studies of science and education, this chapter argues that epistemic practices are interactional (constructed among people through concerted activity), contextual (situated in social practices and cultural norms), intertextual (communicated through a history of coherent discourses, signs, and symbols), and consequential (legitimized knowledge instantiates power and culture). Through a review of science studies, the argument for the relevance of a focus on epistemic practices is developed. This chapter draws from the empirical studies of scientific practice to derive implications for science teaching and learning. There has been considerable empirical work from multiple disciplinary perspectives (cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, and rhetoric) informing perspectives about science and the inner workings of scientific communities. These studies examine the practices, discourses, and cultures of scientists and scientific communities. These perspectives are applied to three types of educational approaches for science learning (through inquiry, engineering, and socioscientific issues) to examine ways that engaging in epistemic practices supports goals of scientific literacy. The chapter shows how a focus on the knowledge construction processes in schools offers contributions to thinking about science education.",

Long term human robot interaction is important in several areas such as for companion robots, rehabilitation, and education. This paper introduces human robot interaction and critically reflects on some of its key challenges. Matthew N. O. Sadiku | Uwakwe C. Chukwu | Abayomi Ajayi-Majebi | Sarhan M.

Is there a space for anthropologists in public debates about our era's acute economic dilemmas? The short answer should be yes, partly because anthropologists are trained to probe social silences and make the invisible visible, and because we reject the pitfalls of Econ 101, oversimplifications that pervade public discourse. Academic anthropologists can draw lessons from what we might term \u2018public economics\u2019, as well as from the writings of Gillian Tett, an award-winning financial columnist trained in anthropology. Perhaps we can also learn a little from tricksters \u2013 or from satirical activists who deploy irony, caricature, and paradox as sharp instruments in this age of austerity and billionaires. As we analyze finance and the economy in the aftermath of a financial meltdown whose causes and policy implications are intensely debated, our challenge still is to satisfy journalists' appetite for sound-bite narratives without sacrificing nuance, historical contingency, and complexity.",

This book is also designed to be a bridge: between quantitative and qualitative methods, individual and collaborative work, and the humanities and social scientists. Exploring Humanities Data Types with R does not presuppose background programming experience. Early chapters take readers from R set-up to exploratory data analysis (continuous and categorical data, multivariate analysis, and advanced graphics with emphasis on aesthetics and facility). Everything is hands-on: networks are explained using U.S. Supreme Court opinions, and low-level NLP methods are applied to short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The book's data, code, appendix with 100 basic programming exercises and solutions, and dedicated website are valuable resources for readers. The methodology will have wide application in classrooms and self-study for the humanities, but also for use in linguistics, anthropology, and political science. Outside the classroom, this intersection of humanities and computing is particularly relevant for research and new modes of dissemination across archives, museums and libraries.",

         "abstract": "In this book J. M. Balkin offers a strikingly original theory of cultural evolution, a theory that explains shared understandings, disagreement, and diversity within cultures.  Drawing on many fields of study - including anthropology, evolutionary theory, cognitive science, linguistics, sociology, political theory, philosophy, social psychology, and law - the author explores how cultures grow and spread, how shared understandings arise, and how people of different cultures can understand and evaluate each other's views.  Cultural evolution occurs through the transmission of cultural information and know-how-\"cultural software\"-in human minds, Balkin says.  Individuals embody cultural software and spread it to others through communication and social learning.  Ideology, the author contends, is neither a special nor a pathological form of thought but an ordinary product of the evolution of cultural software.  Because cultural understanding is a patchwork of older imperfect tools that are continually adapted to solve new problems, human understanding is partly adequate and party inadequate to the pursuit of justice.  Balkin presents numerous examples that illuminate the sources of ideological effects and their contributions to injustice.  He also enters the current debate over multiculturalism, applying his theory to problems of mutual understanding between people who hold different worldviews.  He argues that cultural understanding presupposes transcendent ideals and shows how both ideological analysis of others and ideological self-criticism are possible.",

The primary questions these regulations are meant to resolve include the following: (1) What is yoga? (2) What is its proprietary nature? and (3) Who has the right to manage its expression? Two recent U.S. federal district court cases involving the Bikram Yoga College of India, a yoga franchise based in Los Angeles, have drawn international attention to the debate on whether yogic knowledge or practice resides in the public or private domain. This article asks, if given the monetary value at stake, did the global market for transnational commercial yoga set the stage for claims to individual IPRs? Furthermore, this article analyzes how yoga, due to its unique characteristics as an embodied practice and intangible form, serves as a platform for experimentation from which new meanings of open source, IPRs, and information management strategies emerge.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I would like to thank the Department of Anthropology, the School of Social Sciences, and the Center for Asian Studies at the University of California, Irvine, for their funding support.",

         "volume": "28","number": "4","pages": "497-517","abstract": "This paper starts by examining recent work by applied linguists who argue that creativity is not only a property of especially skilled and gifted language users, but is pervasive in routine everyday practice. Also variously addressing literariness, language play and humour, this apparent democratization of creativity contributes to a more general refocusing within applied linguistics on language users as creative designers of meaning. Alongside the textual analysis of poetic form, there has been an increasing interest in the interactional functions of creativity, suggesting the need for a more dynamic model which can address the dialogical nature of everyday creativity, its sociohistorical dimensions and processes of contextualization. In order to suggest how such a model could be developed, the authors draw on Russian sociohistorical conceptions of the evaluative function of language as social sign and bring together the applied linguistic research with work from linguistic anthropology on contextualization, framing, and reflexivity within performance. While linguistic anthropologists have focused mainly on traditional oral art, the authors argue that the framing and critical potential of performance is also keyed by more fleeting uses of poetic language in everyday interaction. In relation to four contrasting examples of data, they suggest how an integrated analytical framework might be developed which addresses textual, contextual, and critical dimensions of creativity.",

         "abstract": "This work is a bold new effort to embrace all aspects of life--molecular, cellular, behavioral, and cultural--with formulation of a general theory of evolution that extends classical Darwinian theory to include human society.\n\n'Evolutionary Systems and Society 'describes Csanyi's replicative theory of biological and cultural evolution, which represents a major theoretical synthesis of the life sciences and the social sciences. The work spans a vast intellectual and scientific territory, from systems sciences through genetics, cell biology, ethnology, and evolutionary biology to cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and culture. Csanyi demonstrates that the interactions of components in the biological realm (molecules, cells, organisms, ecosystems) and in societies (people, artifacts, ideas) all have a replicative organization. This replicative organization (a mechanism for information storage and reproduction) exists in human societies in a form analogous to biological systems.\n\nJust as the general theory of evolution helps explains the spontaneous emergence of replicative functions and organizations in biological systems, it can be employed to evaluate new departures in social systems. Csanyi uses this concept to explore the origins and evolution of human society and to explain the replicative paradigm to processes of the animal and human mind and to culture. He points out that human culture has all the criteria of a biological system. Its basic components--people, ideas, and man-made artifacts--functionally form a complex replicative network that behaves as systematic unit that evolves at an ever-increasing rate.\n\nIn summarizing the implications of his theory, Csanyimaintains that coordinated replication governed by a regulatory system is necessary if we are to contain the possibility of life-ending nuclear war and insure human survival.",

Ã ce double titre, il a travaillÃ© sur l'Ã©pistÃ©mologie des sciences humaines dans une perspective interdisciplinaire. En convoquant, dans cet entretien, l'apport des sciences psychologiques, et notamment de la psychanalyse, il examine les bases Ã©pistÃ©mologiques de la recherche en traductologie. Ã son sens, la philosophie, la psychanalyse et la traductologie sont trois disciplines rÃ©flexives, c'est-Ã -dire qu'elles font retour sur ce qu'on vit, sur ce qu'on pense et ce qu'on fait. Il plaide pour ce qu'il appelle une traductologie productive, qui s'intÃ©resse non pas Ã  la traduction dÃ©jÃ  faite, mais au processus de traduction, d'oÃ¹ la rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  la psychologie. La traductologie se situerait ainsi Ã  l'articulation de la linguistique et de la littÃ©rature comparÃ©e, surplombÃ©e par la philosophie avec un soubassement en psychologie. Ce sont toutes les sciences humaines et les Ã©tudes culturelles, en dÃ©finitive, qui sont concernÃ©es par cette discipline, en sorte que la traductologie, pour Jean-RenÃ© Ladmiral, tend Ã  prendre l'ampleur d'une anthropologie interdisciplinaire de la traduction. \\$EN\\$Jean-RenÃ© Ladmiral is well-known in translation circles not only as a translation studies scholar and a translator of German philosophy (in particular of JÃ¼rgen Habermas and the Frankfurt School, but also of Kant and Nietzsche), and as a philosopher as well. As such, he has examined the epistemology of social sciences in an interdisciplinary perspective. In this interview, he calls on different schools of psychology and, in particular, on psychoanalysis to discuss the epistemological basis of research in translation studies. In his view, philosophy, psychoanalysis and translation studies are three reflexive disciplines, that is, they reflect on what one experiences, thinks or does. He speaks in favour of what he calls Ã¼ne traductologie productive,\" whose interest lies not in analyzing existing translations but rather the process of translation, and this is why he makes reference to psychology. Translation studies would be situated at the junction of linguistics and comparative literature, with philosophy towering above and psychology as its base. All social sciences and cultural studies are ultimately related to this field of research. For Jean-RenÃ© Ladmiral it tends to take on the scope of an interdisciplinary anthropology of translation.",

The neo-Darwinian synthesis in biology has explained how ethnocentricity might evolve by group selection, and the distinction between evoked culture and adopted culture, suggested by the emerging synthesis in evolutionary psychology, has explained how it might be transmitted. Ethnocentric mechanisms could have evolved by genetic selection in ancestral hominids, or through the interaction of genetic and cultural selection in modern humans, or both. The existence of similar behaviors in chimpanzees and the parallel development of early human societies around the globe are arguments for such inherited mechanisms. There may have been some adaptive breakthroughs in purely cultural evolution, but this process does not seem likely to produce long-term Darwinian adaptations because of the prolificity of cultural traits. Warfare may once have been a major agent of group selection, but the rates of extinction among human groups are so slow as to render this improbable since the rise of state-level societies, whose warfare tends to become a cyclical balance-of-power situation. Perhaps the most serious implication of current evolutionary thought is that the individualistic model of culture common in the social sciences and humanities is outmoded, and should be replaced by a new model that recognizes the organismic nature of human societies.",

New methodological and theoretical approaches have shed light on the meanings and practices that, for good and for bad, turn the state into the great enframer of our lives. States of Imagination draws together the best of this recent critical thinking to explore the postcolonial state. Contributors focus on a variety of locations from Guatemala, Pakistan, and Peru to India and Ecuador and present unique vantage points, including that of rural schools, police departments, small villages, and the inside of the truth commission.Focusing on the micro-politics of everyday state-making, the contributors examine the mythologies, paradoxes, and inconsistencies of the state through ethnographies of diverse postcolonial practices. They show how the authority of the state is constantly challenged from the local as well as the global, and how growing demands to confer rights and recognition to ever more citizens, organisations, and institutions reveal the persistence of the myth of the state as a source of social order and an embodiment of popular sovereignty. Demonstrating the indispensable value of ethnographic work on the practices and the symbols of the state, States of Imagination showcases a range of studies and methods to provide insight into the diverse forms of the postcolonial state as an arena of both political and cultural struggle.This collection will interest students and scholars of anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, political science, and history.",

         "volume": "26","number": "1","pages": "8--28","abstract": "In this article, we describe the eccentric location of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy: while it remains marginal in terms of institutional recognition, it is nevertheless important in terms of the interest it arouses in professors and students alike, and in the amount and quality of publications in the area. The field's general flexibility appeals both to many established researchers, who employ its methodologies to expand the scope of their investigations, and to many students, who become frustrated with disciplinary rigidity and with the difficulty in carrying out academic projects with overtly political underpinnings from the traditional disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. While student demand is clearly strong in much of Latin America, the response to the rise of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy has taken two general forms: (1) an opening up of spaces within existing disciplines (anthropology, communications, literature, etc.) for the more interdisciplinary or politicized work and (2) the foundation of new programmes in Cultural Studies. We use as examples the case studies of Argentina and Colombia, countries that have a completely different academic history and tradition. We survey the diverse ways in which Cultural Studies has entered institutional spaces in both countries. Colombia offers the case of an academy that appears to have welcomed the institutionalization of Cultural Studies, at least superficially, while Argentina appears to have resisted ceding the field institutional space. Nonetheless, its presence in both countries is strongly palpable; it is clearly a force too strong to be suppressed by resistance from the traditional disciplines.",

         "abstract": "From Tokyo to Helsinki, Manhattan to Manila, Howard Rheingold takes us on a journey around the world for a preview of the next techno-cultural shift-a shift he predicts will be as dramatic as the widespread adoption of the PC in the 1980s and the Internet in the 1990s. The coming wave, says Rheingold, is the result of super-efficient mobile communications-cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and wireless-paging and Internet-access devices that will allow us to connect with anyone, anywhere, anytime.From the amusing (\"Lovegetty\" devices in Japan that light up when a person with the right date-potential characteristics appears in the vicinity) to the extraordinary (the overthrow of a repressive regime in the Philippines by political activists who mobilized by forwarding text messages via cell phones), Rheingold gives examples of the fundamentally new ways in which people are already engaging in group or collective action. He also considers the dark side of this phenomenon, such as the coordination of terrorist cells, threats to privacy, and the ability to incite violent behavior.Applying insights from sociology, artificial intelligence, engineering, and anthropology, Rheingold offers a penetrating perspective on the brave new convergence of pop culture, cutting-edge technology, and social activism. At the same time, he reminds us that, as with other technological revolutions, the real impact of mobile communications will come not from the technology itself but from how people use it, resist it, adapt to it, and ultimately use it to transform themselves, their communities, and their institutions.",

         "volume": "8","abstract": "Human-Centered Software Engineering: Bridging HCI, Usability and Software Engineering  From its beginning in the 1980's, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has been defined as a multidisciplinary arena. By this I mean that there has been an explicit recognition that distinct skills and perspectives are required to make the whole effort of designing usable computer systems work well. Thus people with backgrounds in Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) joined with people with backgrounds in various behavioral science disciplines (e. g., cognitive and social psychology, anthropology) in an effort where all perspectives were see nas essential to creating usable systems. But while the field of HCI brings individuals with many background disciplines together to discuss a common goal -- the development of useful, usable, satisfying systems -- the form of the collaboration remains unclear. Are we striving to coordinate the varied activities in system development, or are we seeking a richer collaborative framework? In coordination, Usability and SE skills can remain quite distinct and while the activities of each group might be critical to the success of a project, we need only insure that critical results are provided at appropriate points in the development cycle. Communication by one group to the other during an activity might be seen as only minimally necessary. In collaboration, there is a sense that each group can learn something about its own methods and processes through a close partnership with the other. Communication during the process of gathering information from target users of a system by usability professionals would not be seen as something that gets in the way of the essential work of software engineering professionals.",

         "abstract": "Providing a complete portal to the world of case study research, the Fourth Edition of Robert K. Yin's bestselling text \"Case Study Research\" offers comprehensive coverage of the design and use of the case study method as a valid research tool. This thoroughly revised text now covers more than 50 case studies (approximately 25 per cent new), gives fresh attention to quantitative analyses, discusses more fully the use of mixed methods research designs, and includes new methodological insights. The book's coverage of case study research and how it is applied in practice gives readers access to exemplary case studies drawn from a wide variety of academic and applied fields. The fourth edition highlights each specific research feature through 44 boxed vignettes that feature previously published case studies. It provides methodological insights to show the similarities between case studies and other social science methods. It suggests a three-stage approach to help readers define the initial questions they will consider in their own case study research. It covers new material on human subjects protection, the role of Institutional Review Boards, and the interplay between obtaining IRB approval and the final development of the case study protocol and conduct of a pilot case. It includes an overall graphic of the entire case study research process at the beginning of the book, then highlights the steps in the process through graphics that appear at the outset of all the chapters that follow. It offers in-text learning aids including 'tips' that pose key questions and answers at the beginning of each chapter, practical exercises, endnotes, and a new cross-referencing table. \"Case Study Research, Fourth Edition\" is ideal for courses in departments of Education, Business and Management, Nursing and Public Health, Public Administration, Anthropology, Sociology, and Political Science.",

         "abstract": "Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open-ocean racing sailor and navigator in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce a new reading of cognitive science. His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation - its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory - \"in the wild\". Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that differ from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture; thus the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system. Introducing life in the Navy and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he adopts David Marr's paradigm and applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation - to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced inMicronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that involve multiple individuals. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition and points to ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.",

         "abstract": "Humans are a striking anomaly in the natural world. While we are similar to\r\nother mammals in many ways, our behavior sets us apart. Our unparalleled\r\nability to adapt has allowed us to occupy virtually every habitat on earth\r\nusing an incredible variety of tools and subsistence techniques. Our societies\r\nare larger, more complex, and more cooperative than any other mammal's. In\r\nthis stunning exploration of human adaptation, Peter J. Richerson and Robert\r\nBoyd argue that only a Darwinian theory of cultural evolution can explain\r\nthese unique characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\_Not by Genes Alone\\_ offers a radical interpretation of human evolution,\r\narguing that our ecological dominance and our singular social systems stem\r\nfrom a psychology uniquely adapted to create complex culture. Richerson and\r\nBoyd illustrate here that culture is neither superorganic nor the handmaiden\r\nof the genes. Rather, it is essential to human adaptation, as much a part of\r\nhuman biology as bipedal locomotion. Drawing on work in the fields of\r\nanthropology, political science, sociology, and economics\u2014and building their\r\ncase with such fascinating examples as kayaks, corporations, clever knots, and\r\nyams that require twelve men to carry them\u2014Richerson and Boyd convincingly\r\ndemonstrate that culture and biology are inextricably linked, and they show us\r\nhow to think about their interaction in a way that yields a richer\r\nunderstanding of human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn abandoning the nature-versus-nurture debate as fundamentally misconceived,\r\n\\_Not by Genes Alone\\_ is a truly original and groundbreaking theory of the role\r\nof culture in evolution and a book to be reckoned with for generations to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n \u201D I continue to be surprised by the number of educated people (many of them\r\nbiologists) who think that offering explanations for human behavior in terms\r\nof culture somehow disproves the suggestion that human behavior can be\r\nexplained in Darwinian evolutionary terms. Fortunately, we now have a book to\r\nwhich they may be directed for enlightenment . . . . It is a book full of good\r\nsense and the kinds of intellectual rigor and clarity of writing that we have\r\ncome to expect from the Boyd/Richerson stable.\u201D\u2014Robin Dunbar, \\_Nature\r\n\r\n\r\n\\_ \u201D \\_Not by Genes Alone\\_ is a valuable and very readable synthesis of a still\r\nembryonic but very important subject straddling the sciences and\r\nhumanities.\u201D\u2014E.

(Adrienne Rich) In today's world of global connections Adrienne Rich's poem 'Our Whole Life a Translation' can be seen not simply as a beautiful metaphor for the untranslatability of human experience but very much as a reality for many women who live mobilities. If 'our whole life is a translation', we cannot help wondering: what then is the original? Is it another text, another experience or another reality? Many years ago Walter Benjamin defined translation as 'a mode', i.e. simultaneously a condition and a form of movement between texts and cultures, reminding his readers that 'a translation issues from the origi-nal' and 'it comes later than the original' (1999: 72). Therefore translation is not simply a linguistic movement of words and texts from one language into another but a move-ment of selves in/through language to other places, cultures, selves and positions \u2013 a signal of dynamic processes of continuation, change and transformation. By employing the whole gamut of ambiguity in the concept of 'translation', this spe-cial issue of the European Journal of Women's Studies explores the complex connections between words and worlds, between self and Other(s), between the translating subject and the object/context of translation from a gendered point of view. At the same time, the lens of translation offers alternative modes and scenarios for interpreting women's lives and identities \u2013 from the quotidian aspects of living, education and work to the more exceptional aspects of female creativity, subjectivity and expression in another language. The articles that follow raise multiple important and provocative questions: What does it mean to live in translation? How is femininity constructed, deconstructed, and recon-structed when transmitted from one language/culture to another? Is stereotypical understanding of femininity/masculinity reinforced or obliterated in the movement from one historical and social context to another? How do gender binaries and hierarchies Editorial by guest on January 12, 2016 ejw.sagepub.com Downloaded from 332 European Journal of Women's Studies 18(4) travel in translation and what effects do they have on the translation process? And vice versa \u2013 how is gender reconfigured in the movement from one linguistic and cultural environment to another? What strategies can make women more visible in/through translation? Of course, many similar questions have been raised previously by scholars in wom-en's studies, translation studies as well as in other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. In the last three decades translation studies as an 'interdiscipline' (Snell-Hornby, 2006: 72) has moved away from the linguistic aspects of translation as text-based towards translation as culture and politics, exploring the role of various social categories in translation such as gender, ethnicity, class, ideology, history and tradition. It has drawn insights from sociology, anthropology, literary and postcolonial theory, cul-tural studies, philosophy, psychology and many other areas. For example, postcolonial scholars have shown how translation practices are always embedded in structures of power and knowledge, often imposing particular values and norms or masking inequali-ties (Bhabha, 1994; Rodriguez, 2008; Spivak, 1992). Along similar lines Lawrence Venuti equates these processes with doing violence: The violence of translation resides in its very purpose and activity: the reconstruction of the foreign text in accordance with values, beliefs, and representations that pre-exist in the target language, always configured in hierarchies of dominance and marginality, always determining the production, circulation, and reception of texts. (Venuti, 1996: 196).",

         "abstract": "Understanding Collapse explores the collapse of ancient civilisations, such as the Roman Empire, the Maya, and Easter Island. In this lively survey, Guy D. Middleton critically examines our ideas about collapse - how we explain it and how we have constructed potentially misleading myths around collapses - showing how and why collapse of societies was a much more complex phenomenon than is often admitted. Rather than positing a single explanatory model of collapse - economic, social, or environmental - Middleton gives full consideration to the overlooked resilience in communities of ancient peoples and the choices that they made. He offers a fresh interpretation of collapse that will be accessible to both students and scholars. The book is an engaging, introductory-level survey of collapse in the archaeology/history literature, which will be ideal for use in courses on the collapse of civilizations, sustainability, and climate change. It includes up-to-date case studies of famous and less well-known examples of collapses, and is illustrated with 25 black and white illustrations, 3 line drawings, 16 tables and 18 maps.\n\nReviews\n'Middleton\u2019s book is the best introduction to 'collapsology'. It carefully dissects theories, especially grand theories, and marshals data so that the reader can see what collapses (and what doesn\u2019t) in major cases from Rome and Egypt to the Maya and Easter Island. It is informative from beginning to end and gracefully written.'\n\nNorman Yoffee - University of Michigan\n\n'Moving well beyond the traditional rise-and-fall schemas of civilizational studies, Guy D. Middleton asks us to consider the complexities of human approaches to political sustainability across space and time. By doing so, he creates a deeper understanding of the variability in human agency and political decision-making. Along the way, he exposes myth-making both in the past and the present. This engaging, accessible, and comprehensively researched book offers no monolithic explanation for past crises of governance but astutely assesses human socio-ecological interactions in a wide range of archaic states and empires. This book is an essential read for every aspiring student of past (and current) political collapse.'\n\nPatricia A. McAnany - Kenan Eminent Professor and Chair, Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\n\n'Middleton aims to provide an introduction to \u2018collapsology\u2019, offering a wide-ranging and impressively comprehensive overview of previous scholarship, written in an accessible and succinct way that will be appealing for undergraduate or graduate courses on the collapse of complex societies, or for scholars seeking overviews of regions in which they do not specialize.'\n\nSource: Cambridge Archaeological Journal",

         "volume": "11","number": "1","pages": "3-55","abstract": "The creative mind remains largely uncharted despite the efforts of\n\tinvestigators from many fields. Discussions arising from the perspective\n\tof evolutionary biology have helped somewhat to clarify the problems\n\tsurrounding human creative activity. However, even the most advanced\n\tevolutionary treatments are unable to provide thorough explanations\n\tof creative activity or to deal productively with its effects on\n\tbehavior and society. Moreover, it appears that such explanations\n\twill not be forthcoming within the current evolutionary paradigm.\n\tOur purpose in this report is to present a potentially new evolutionary\n\tapproach to human creativity.We begin by introducing the concept\n\tof a system in which the components of individual cognition, including\n\tintelligence, learning, memory, personality and motivation interact\n\twith features of the sociocultural environment such as social stratification,\n\teducational policies and modes of communication to influence the\n\tcreative process, discovery and innovation. Implicit in this concept\n\tis the assertion that a productive characterization of the creative\n\tprocess cannot be stated solely by reference to a single level of\n\torganization. Empirical evidence corroborating this assertion is\n\texamined.Our system concept is then integrated with current theories\n\tof biocultural dynamics, leading to the hypothesis that creative\n\tactivity is an evolved strategy in which rules of cognitive development\n\tact through the joint inheritance of genetic and cultural information.\n\tData from cognitive science, social anthropology and behavior genetics,\n\ttesting the hypothesis of genetic involvement in creative development,\n\tare presented and discussed. Building on previous investigations,\n\twe suggest that creative potential in particular problem domains\n\trelates to the organization of semantic networks through the forging\n\tof links among previously dissociated elements. Formalization of\n\tthis linking thesis in turn generates several quantitative predictions\n\tabout domain specificity, the relationship between creative potential\n\tand age, environmental complexity, and various aspects of the sociocultural\n\tenvironment.A central problem in our theory of discovery and innovation\n\tis how creative activity is instantiated in the functional architecture\n\tof the brain. We develop a model in which creative activity is related\n\tto the patterns of activation among collections of neurons that are\n\tinnately predisposed to respond to particular patterns of electrochemical\n\texcitation. In this formulation, the creative process -- manifested\n\tat the cognitive level by the establishment of new linkages among\n\tnodes in the existing knowledge structure -- arises as a consequence\n\tof the elaboration of a novel sequence of group selection events.\n\tThe model is found to generate a number of testable predictions concerning,\n\tfor example, the relationship between creative potential and temporal\n\tenvironmental heterogeneity. Moreover, it appears to offer an explanation\n\tfor such individual characteristics as the domain-specificity of\n\tcreative potential. A particularly intriguing prediction arising\n\tfrom the model is that above some basal level of sensorimotor activity,\n\tcreativity may well be independent of the primary information transduction\n\tcapacities of the organism.The concluding sections of the report\n\tdevelop two related themes. First, we suggest that current mathematical\n\tmodels of cultural change and gene-culture coevolution have difficulty\n\tdealing with intervals of history containing successive innovations.\n\tIn the existing formulations, creative potentials, innovation rates,\n\tetc. are likely to enter as extrinsic parameters or driving forces\n\tsimilar to mutation rates, rather than as causal outcomes of developmental\n\tand behavioral events within the system. This limits their usefulness\n\tin applications to culturally transmitted novelty. However, it is\n\tpossible at least to begin construction of improved formal frameworks,\n\tthe so-called superspace theories, which can better accomodate unforeseen\n\tdiscoveries and their consequences. This step makes possible improved\n\tmacroevolutionary treatments of social change. Second, we consider\n\tin some detail the possibility that the formidable problems posed\n\tby creative diversity can be surmounted or at least eased. Our analysis\n\tsuggests that all types of creative products may well be accommodated\n\twithin a single multidimensional space of basic properties, with\n\tindividual elements differing according to the particulars of their\n\tassociated symbol systems and sustaining cognitive processes. Some\n\ttentative taxonomic principles are developed and applied. Preliminary\n\tevaluation of these classifications suggests that human creativity\n\twill be further clarified by the continued synthesis of evolutionary\n\tbiology with the cognitive sciences.",

         "abstract": "This book examines the contributions of the transhumanism approach to technology, in particular the contributed chapters are wary of the implications of this popular idea.The volume is organized into four parts concerning philosophical, military, technological and sociological aspects of transhumanism, but the reader is free to choose various reading patterns. Topics discussed include gene editing, the singularity, ethical machines, metaphors in AI, mind uploading, and the philosophy of art, and some perspectives taken or discussed examine transhumanism within the context of the philosophy of technology, transhumanism as a derailed anthropology, and critical sociological aspects that consider transhumanism in the context of topical concerns such as whiteness, maleness, and masculinity.The book will be of value to researchers engaged with artificial intelligence, and the ethical, societal, and philosophical impacts of science and technology.",

Now widely available in the United States for the first time and updated with a new preface, these influential essays by a distinguished group of scholars and cultural critics lay the groundwork for a vital and exciting new field of inquiry.\n\nCulture, Globalization and the World-System views culture through different prisms and categories---including race, gender, ethnicity, class, and nation. The contributors consider how socially organized systems of meaning are produced and represented. Drawing from sociology, art history, film studies, and anthropology, these essays---many of them representing their authors' only treatment of globalization---provide paradigms for understanding cultures and the representation of identity in 'the world as a single place.'",

Dies gilt fÃ¼r zwar alle Gesellschaften; doch erst die Geschichtlichkeit und KulturalitÃ¤t dieser kÃ¶rperlichen Prozesse erzeugen die Vielfalt sozialer Handlungen. Ihre rÃ¤umliche und zeitliche Rahmung verweist darauf, wie sie zu vollziehen und zu verstehen sind. Soziales Handeln beruht auf inkorporiertem Wissen, bildet sich in Sprach- und Handlungsspielen, entsteht im Gebrauch, ist gestisch und widersetzt sich der Reduktion auf IntentionalitÃ¤t und FunktionalitÃ¤t; denn es ist auch expressiv, ostentativ und ludisch.

Les publications\r\n\r\n\tamÃ©ricaines sur l'Ã©thique du care et ses rapports avec l'Ã©thique\r\n\r\n\tde la justice ayant Ã©tÃ© comparÃ©es, non sans quelque sarcasme, Ã  une\r\n\r\n\tvÃ©ritable industrie, l'indiffÃ©rence des milieux acadÃ©miques et des\r\n\r\n\tfÃ©minismes franÃ§ais vis-Ã -vis d'un mouvement intellectuellement aussi\r\n\r\n\timportant est Ã©trange. Le moment semble donc venu de prÃ©senter l'Ã©thique\r\n\r\n\tdu care, et de mettre en Ã©vidence les raisons d'une telle rÃ©sistance.\r\n\r\n\tC'est bien la dimension provocatrice de l'idÃ©e mÃªme d'une Ã©thique\r\n\r\n\tdu care qui la rend difficilement assimilable, et vulnÃ©rable.

We now realize that reconstructing why unique human attributes evolved requires an understanding of our starting point, but this is a relatively recent perspective. One hundred years ago, the question of human origins was identical to that of hominin origins. Accepting Australopithecus into human ancestry, coupled with the modern synthesis of evolution, led anthropologists to consider humans as products of natural selection. They realized that increased intelligence did not initially distinguish our lineage, and that early hominins were apelike in many ways. Australopithecus brought bipedality, and brain expansion came with Homo. Because the human mind and behavior are products of evolution, we must reconstruct the selective pressures that shaped our lineage in order to understand ourselves today. Paleoanthropology, as with all anthropology, is becoming ever more question oriented, drawing on many areas of inquiry.",

Anthropometry first developed in the 19th century as a method employed by physical anthropologists for the study of human variation and evolution in both living and extinct populations. Specifically, anthropomorphic measurements involve the size e.g., height, weight, surface area, and volume , structure e.g., sitting vs. standing height, shoulder and hip width, arm leg length, and neck circumference , and composition e.g., percentage of body fat, water content, and lean body mass of humans. Anthropometric measurements have been used historically as a means to associate racial, cultural, and psychological attributes with physical properties. The historical use of anthropometry has been applied to a wide range of applications, including Palaeoanthropology and human evolution, Biological anthropology, Craniometry and craniofacial attributes, Phylogeography, Criminology and Forensics, Phrenology, Physiognomy, Personality and mental typology. In ancient Anthropometry ie in PramanaSharir, the overall measurements were done in Swa AngulaPramana. Our Seers explained the concept of Swa AngulaPramana. It can be ideal parameter irrespective of sex, race and place. The concept of PramanaSharir in Ayurveda is unique. Irrespective of only using PramanaSharir in prognosis and diagnosis of patients, it is worth useful in knowing longevity of an individual. So, it is necessary to explore the concept of PramanaSharir \u2013 an ancient tool of Anthropometric measurement and its utility in current era.

         "abstract": "This volume is concerned with establishing foundations for interaction design. \"Foundations\" strikes me as an ambitious metaphor, suggesting, as it does, a solid base upon which a single, unified edifice will be erected. And, following the metaphor a step further, it assumes the existence of a stable, well organized community with a shared set of values that is ready to embark upon a such construction project.\r\n\r\nI don't believe these assumptions hold up. To me, the state of interaction design feels more primitive. Rather than being an organized community, interaction design feels closer to being composed of a number of roving tribes who occasionally enounter one another, warily engage, and, finding the engagements stimulating, remain open to other encounters.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, how do we make progress? I suggest that rather than trying to construct a unified, coherent account of interaction design, we would do better to take a more syncretic approach, gathering appropriate concepts and exploring their interplay without, however, insisting on resolving their tensions and contradictions.\r\n\r\nIn this essay I explore these issues. I begin with a definition, and illustrate my approach to partitioning the terrain of interaction design using five conceptual \"lenses.\" In so doing, I cover most of what I see as the theoretical roots of interaction design. I then turn to the role of theory in interaction design, and suggest that a good way to begin is to assemble a toolkit of concepts for interaction design that consists of appropriately sized theoretical constructs.",
         "comment" : "Mind\r\nThis is the lens most often deployed by interaction designers versed in human-computer interaction, and is of critical import in the design of screen-based applications.\r\n\r\nProxemics\r\nThis is the domain of ethnomethodologists such as Adam Kendon (1990), sociologists such as Erving Goffman (1963), and anthropologists such as Edward Hall (1983), who focus on the role of expression, posture, gaze, gesture and timing in interactions within small groups. This lens is important for those concerned with designing material artifacts--especially large artifacts such as control panels, rooms and buildings--as well as those designing digital systems which support mediated (i.e. disembodied) interaction.\r\n\r\nArtifacts\r\nThis lens--with the glimpses it gives of artifacts and their varied roles--is important for those who design material artifacts, as well as for those who aim to replace material objects with digital 'equivalents.'\r\n\r\nThe Social\r\nThis is the realm of social psychology, sociology (Goffman, 1963), ethnomethodology (Heath & Luff, 2000) and anthropology (Whyte, 1988). This lens is essential to any interaction designer wishing to reflect upon ways in which a newly designed artifact may disrupt situations in which it is introduced, or the ways in which--as with a web-based chess game--the digital equivalent of a face to face interaction may have very different social effects.\r\n\r\nThe Ecological\r\nJane Jacobs, Kunstler, etc.",

         "abstract": "Depuis Les Fondements naturels de l'Ã©thique, datant de 1993 et dirigÃ© par Jean-Pierre Changeux, aucun ouvrage collectif publiÃ© en France n'a prÃ©sentÃ© les travaux interdisciplinaires qui ont pour but, depuis plusieurs dÃ©cennies, d'appliquer les connaissances scientifiques Ã  la moralitÃ© humaine. Pourtant, ces travaux sont trÃ¨s nombreux et touchent Ã  plusieurs domaines : biologie Ã©volutionniste, sciences cognitives, anthropologie culturelle, psychologie morale, Ã©thique expÃ©rimentale, etc. Ils ont accompli des avancÃ©es considÃ©rables et apportent des informations prÃ©cieuses sur les origines, le dÃ©veloppement, et les fondements des normes et valeurs humaines. Il offre Ã  un large public (scientifiques, chercheurs en philosophie des sciences et en philosophie morale, mais Ã©galement de tous ceux intÃ©ressÃ©s par les relations entre sciences et morale) une synthÃ¨se des questions abordÃ©es par les travaux contemporains. Le projet de naturalisation de la morale a bien souvent eu mauvaise presse en France : la rÃ©putation sulfureuse de l'Ã©volutionnisme, du darwinisme social et de la sociobiologie ont ainsi longtemps soulevÃ© une rÃ©ticence certaines quant Ã  la possibilitÃ© et Ã  la lÃ©gitimitÃ© de l'application du discours scientifique Ã  la morale humaine. Nous montrons donc que, par delÃ  les polÃ©miques, le projet de naturalisation de la morale permet de reconsidÃ©rer nombre de problÃ¨mes classiques, susceptibles d'Ã©veiller tout autant la curiositÃ© du nÃ©ophyte que celle du scientifique chevronnÃ© : conflit entre universalisme et relativisme, usage des vertus morales, rapport entre dÃ©terminisme et libertÃ©, question de l'innÃ© et de l'acquis, lien entre faits et valeurs, etc. A l'heure oÃ¹ les biotechnologies commencent Ã  modifier la configuration gÃ©nÃ©tique de l'espÃ¨ce humaine, jusqu'Ã  quel point la nature humaine constitue-t-elle encore un modÃ¨le permettant d'Ã©valuer dÃ©cisions individuelles et choix politiques ? Quelles sont les possibilitÃ©s et les limites de la connaissance scientifique de la nature humaine dans le domaine de la bioÃ©thique et de l'Ã©thique appliquÃ©e ? Voici les nombreuses interrogations, parmi tant d'autres, auxquelles ce livre se propose d'apporter des Ã©lÃ©ments de rÃ©ponse. La raretÃ© des ouvrages en langue francaise portant sur les rapports entre sciences contemporaines et moralitÃ© humaine le rend particuliÃ¨rement utile.\n\nTable des matiÃ¨res.\n\npage 11 / \nLuc Faucher : PrÃ©face\n\npage 35 / \nJÃ©rÃ´me Ravat : Introduction\n\npage 47 / \nPremiÃ¨re partie.

In questo libro si possono scoprire i luoghi che creano marginalit e invisibilit sociale: il diritto, la politica, la cultura, il linguaggio, la scuola, la famiglia, i mass media(vecchi e nuovi). E si possono rintracciare anche gli attori che le producono: imprenditori politici ed economici, operatori dell? informazione, insegnanti, opinion maker e ma tre penser. I saggi qui raccolti, analizzando le varie forme di discriminazione(razziale, sessuale, religiosa, sociale)e individuando le complesse relazioni tra chi la produce e le vittime che la subiscono, mettono in luce, al di l di ogni ragionevole dubbio, come le politiche e le pratiche discriminatorie vengano messe in atto, sia per via normativa, sia attraverso elaborazioni ideologiche che portano alla? costruzione? del nemico, ovvero del soggetto impegnato a sovvertire i valori della societ. Le discriminazioni, insomma, sono qui interpretate come l? effetto cumulativo, e talvolta volontario, di politiche legate da una comune logica esclusiva. Il volume raccoglie le riflessioni e le analisi di studiosi di varia formazione: sociologi(pi o meno giovani), esperti di diritti umani, psicologi, filosofi, antropologi, oltre che insegnanti, maestri di strada e operatori sociali. Questi studiosi, lavorando insieme, sono riusciti a superare i confini, a volte troppo angusti, delle? appartenenze accademiche?, raggiungendo un risultato notevole in termini di multidisciplinariet e offrendo al lettore un potenziale conoscitivo non indifferente sulle diverse forme che l? esclusione e la marginalit possono assumere.

         "description" : "\r\nI have chosen this book because i do gender studies and i knew that the author of the book Caroline Moser is a gender specialist working with tools for gender analysis in development planning for past 30 years. Also Moser is a lecturer in the University of Manchester and an academic specialising in social policy and urban anthropology in gender perspective. She introduces her book explaining how important is the problem of violence in the cities now, especially if we are talking about women. This the example of Ecuador she explains that if the streets are not safe for women, the city itself limitates life opportunities for women providing their social isolation. Moser argues the not static nature of urban violence which face is rapidly changing and propose to analyze violence as a multi-layered concept. To achieve this goal she points out the necessity to make a \u201Cskeleton\u201D of urban violence: define multiple forms of violence, identify trends and characteristics, find causes and consequences and search for different types of interventions to reduce violence on different levels. The same challenges facing all urban researchers which articles are included in the book. \r\n\r\nI decided to concentrate on one article that treats the theme of security and fear in urban spaces in South Africa with the title Â«A new apartheid? The spatial implications of fear of crime in Cape Town, South AfricaÂ» by Charlotte Lemanski. The author of the article - Charlotte Lemanski - is a lecturer in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge. She concentrate her researches on the urban realities of South Africa analyzing concepts of gentrification, security, governance, integration in the patterns of cities. Lemanski worked with children in South Africa and made her doctoral research about social integration in post-apartheid Cape Town. \r\n\r\nThe research of Charlotte Lemanski was made in the context of the statistic of an alarming increase in serious crime over recent years that decreases security in South Africa. This article focuses specifically on Cape Town. Lemanski consider that Â«fear of crime is spatially, socially and temporally distributedÂ» and in this conditions the sense of protection that is needed by citizens is expressed via urban forms. Lemanski operates with the concepts of Â«spatial responseÂ» and Â«risk managementÂ» to show how the emotions (fear, in this case) change the city landscape. \r\n\r\nIn the history of urbanism fear was always presented as influencing city planning and here Lemanski shows the examples of pre-modern city constructed walls and gates, \u201Cpanoptic\u201D prison design for anonymous surveillance of prisoners and even Haussman\u2019s Parisian reconstruction that was guided by the fear of the new revolution. Nowadays new cities are planned concerning the strategies to minimize the sense of insecurity for the citizens but citizens have their own individual response to the fear.\r\n\r\nLemanski argues that the urban practices in Cape Town make a kind of spiral development and come back again to residential segregation but now these changes are not race-based but a result of a constant sense of fear. The end of apartheid were seen as an end the violence in South Africa, but since 1990 a new wave of urban criminal activity is spreading into previously protected white suburbs. The statistics of 2002 indicate that although violent crime is decreasing, robbery and residential burglary are increasing. Despite reductions in some crime levels, one-third of crimes in South Africa are violent. Regarding sociospatial distribution of institutional resources not all citizens of Cape Town are protected equally: despite lower crime rates in former white areas, they host the majority of police stations, and inhabitants are more protected by infrastructure (e.g. private cars, street lighting) and better able to afford private security. In contrast, poorer blacks inhabit areas with weak \u201Cdefensible space\u201D (e.g. no street lighting or telephones, abandoned open spaces), are poorly policed and cannot afford private security. This spatial distribution of victimization and resources strongly affects fear of crime. \r\n\r\nThe fear presents as a common sense in Cape Town: in 1998 only 28% of Capetonians felt \u201Cvery safe\u201D in their daytime residential area compared to almost 60% in the nation as a whole. In the absence of urban controls citizens are responding independently on this insecurity and fear-provoked residential fortification is common to both poor and wealthy even if the practices are not equal for different social groups. To avoid crime South Africans not only use basic strategies such as dogs, window grilles and high fences but also fortifying entire neighbourhoods, closing street access, erecting electrified fences and high walls, as well as employing private security guards and CCTV to patrol and monitor their citadels. This desire for maximum security has led to numerous illegally enclosed neighbourhoods and the authorities can\u2019t control the process so fast. \r\n\r\nAs a result enclosing neighbourhoods have had a perverse effect, leaving both public and private spaces devoid of natural surveillance and thereby less safe. The sense of insecurity in the city has divided black and white people, rich and poor by creating a Â«tribal territorialismÂ» that served to increase fears and deepen segregation. Replacing public space with private space made a decline in public order while segregation encouraged the polarization of social groups in distinct universes. These enclaves deepen the segregation and reinforce fear by excluding difference and limiting social mixing, thus increasing paranoia and mistrust between groups. These enclaves deepen the segregation and reinforce fear by excluding difference and limiting social mixing promoting escapist mentalities (here author shoes good example with the frase \u201Cnot in my back yard\u201D).\r\n\r\nCharlotte Lemanski concludes that Â«high walls, dogs, armed guards and enclosed neighbourhoods have not brought peace of mind but have reproduced fears (via Â«talk of crimeÂ»), as homogenous groups are sociospatially distanced from their Â«otherÂ». She claims that these fear-provoked practices are similar to urban apartheid as the apartheid encouraged all races to consider themselves separate nations with distinct physical boundaries. But now these boundaries are more than real and they make Cape Town a Â«city of exclusions, not inclusionsÂ». As an alternative solution she proposes the reconciliation of urban planning and citizen needs in order to embrace diversity and combat symbolic exclusionism. But for Lemanski it can happen only if we admit sociospatial nature of fear. \r\n\r\nFor me this article is interesting because it evokes the relation between the space and the sentiment. We live in the city and we use urban spaces but we have a sense of each space, an emotion with is related with every practice made in this space. In my specialization Â«Geography and GenderÂ» we use the concept of Â«space of fearÂ» that helps to analyze how women use urban spaces including through their feelings of space, their subjective perception of the space. Unfortunately, Charlotte Lemanski doesn\u2019t work in gender perspective but for urban planning studying her approach can be very interesting. \r\n ",

         "abstract": "\"In the first quarter of the twentieth century, massive forest fires raged throughout Kumaon in the western Indian Himalaya. Only some of these fires were the usual summer fires. Between 1911 and 1916, the colonial state had reclassified nearly 80 percent of Kumaon's forests into reserves. Villagers found that they had limited or no rights left in the reserves. In response they set fires in the newly classified reserves in a vivid spectacle of challenge to new forms of government over nature. Official reports and surviving accounts of villagers' actions suggest that many fires were deliberate protests against state interventions.\"",

         "review" : "Those who have grown tired of doomsday scenarios about the environment would do well to pick up a copy of Environmentality. This book, an engaging and groundbreaking investigation of environmental politics and how people come to care for the environment, while not a call to arms, signals that change may already be on the way.  Drawing upon extensive fieldwork and archival research of forest protection in forty villages of Kumaon in Northern India, Arun Agrawal, Associate Professor in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Michigan, traces how these rural communities came to be willing and active agents of decentralized environmental regulation and to embrace principles of forest conservation. He demonstrates that dispersing power, knowledge, and regulation?and thereby creating more ?intimate forms of regulation??can lead to changes in the way people understand their place and actions in relation to something that they define as ?the environment.? This shift toward localizing regulatory power, which is taking place in more than fifty countries by Agrawal?s count, is a message of hope for the environment and for humankind.  Agrawal?s thesis and approach are signaled by his carefully chosen title. \"Environmentality\" gestures at Foucault?s later work on governmentality, which aims to ?understand and describe how modern forms of power and regulation achieve their full effects not by forcing people toward state-mandated goals but by turning them into accomplices? (p. 217). ?Environmentality,? a term of Agrawal?s own invention, refers to the creation of environmental subjects along with the emergence of the ?environment? as a domain that requires regulation and protection.  The Kumaon region in the Himalayas is the site of the fabled Chipko movement, which began in 1973 when villagers organized for the restoration of forest rights and which quickly spread throughout India. Agrawal?s interest is not in the movement, however, but in an earlier historical development: the creation of village-level forest councils. An outgrowth of political negotiations following widespread and sometimes violent village uprisings in the 1920s against the British colonial state?s creation of forest reserves, the forest councils now number over 3,000 and constitute one of the earliest surviving attempts to secure public participation in the preservation of forests. In his detailed historical account of the events leading to the creation of the reserves by the colonial state during 1911?16, Agrawal describes the application of a ?new technology of government??policy tools for environmental management?to bring the forests under central control in order to sustain the supply of timber and its products, which by the second half of the nineteenth century had become an increasingly important source of state revenue. Initially, government technology to protect the forests relied solely upon the classification and use of statistics to characterize forests, thereby creating an environmental sphere as a ?domain fit for government.? The imposition of new rules rendered illegal many of the subsistence practices of shifting cultivators, graziers, villagers, and local merchants, and existing rules were enforced more strictly. The locals who relied on forests for their livelihoods perceived these policies as a denial of their rights, resulting in massive protest through the setting of fires. Even the village headman appointed by the colonial government, resisted cooperation with the regime.  The new technology of the forest councils had three important effects: first, the creation of decision-making within localities, which significantly increased local people?s power vis-Ã -vis the state; second, the creation of ?regulatory communities? within localities where social actions could take form; and three, the creation of ?environmental subjects??people who came to think in new ways about the importance of the environment to their lives. The achievements of the forest councils created to resolve this crisis, by Agrawal?s account, are most impressive:   Today decision makers within the community use their intimate knowledge about members of the community to ensure that power is wielded neither too forcefully nor too weakly. They don?t want to provoke protests or be rendered ineffective. Community regulation operates more constantly, consistently, effectively and transformatively on its objects: village residents. Regulation is more comprehensive but less costly, more modulated but less visible, more autonomous but more continuous, more precise, and perhaps, for that reason, more humane. (p. 93)   Among the achievements of this book are the interventions Agrawal makes in several long-standing scholarly debates. First, he marks new ground on the question of the degree to which colonial rule influenced how humans exploited natural resources, what is sometimes referred to as the ?great ecology and colonialism debate.? On the one side of the debate, represented by Indian historian Ramachandra Guha, are those who deem the centrally controlled forest reserve policies socially unjust; on the other side, represented by scholar Richard Grove and his colleagues, are those who emphasize the necessary role the forest reserve policy played in saving the forests. But for Agrawal, the most enduring and significant legacy of colonial intervention on the environment is the state?s deployment of statistics to create the very notion of the ?environment? and define its value. He points out that the numbers are not ?just a faithful representation of an underlying uncontested reality.? Rather, the choice of particular statistical methods and of the particular classification of timber and timber products depended upon ?political and economic choices about what to measure, how to measure it, how often to measure, and how to present and interpret the results? (p. 37). In this way, Agrawal shifts attention away from the nature of colonialism?s rupture with pre-colonial practices and to the continuity of the influence of colonialism?s ?technologies of government.? In the case of Kumaon, prior to the creation of the forest councils, the technologies of government were used to exercise control and ?govern from a distance.? Thereafter, a new technology of government was introduced that relied on localities as partners in successful regulation. Second, Agrawal resists the tendency to explain environmental attitudes, beliefs, and actions in terms of static social categories such as gender, caste, and wealth. Instead, he argues that the critical factor in variations among attitudes and practices is the individual?s social position and involvement within regulatory practices. Carefully laying out his interview data, Agrawal shows how variations in the forms of monitoring and enforcement across forest councils consistently produced variations in the willingness of the individual to participate in regulation?the villagers who participate more in monitoring, either through labor or money, also express the greatest interest in forest preservation.  Third, Agrawal encourages a reconsideration of the relationship between beliefs and practices. Against the common assumption that beliefs determine practice, Agrawal draws upon his data to show that it is often precisely the opposite: beliefs and knowledge are developed through practice. People come to act in response to a situation about which they often have little control. In experiencing that act and its outcome they often find that earlier beliefs were mistaken, and they change them. Agrawal writes: ?Environmental practice . . . is the key link between the regulatory rule that government is all about and the imaginations that characterize particular links? (p. 167). A key lesson of the Kumaon story is that policies that successfully promote environmental values are more likely to be prompted by concerns for the fair distribution of resources and the political recognition of a community than a concern for preservation, which is instead developed in the process of implementing those policies.  In the concluding chapter, Agrawal acknowledges scholarly contributions to environmental politics and so helps his readers to navigate the environmental studies literature. In his assessment, the fields of conservation biology, environmental anthropology, environmental ethics, environmental sociology, historical ecology, and social ecology are of little help, since their main purpose appears to be to convince mainstream historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists of the benefits to their disciplines of paying greater attention to the environment. Instead, he points to the cross-disciplinary fields of political ecology, scholarship on the commons, and feminist environmentalism as the most helpful in the direct attention they give to how institutions, politics, and identities affect environmental policy processes and outcomes. At the same time he highlights the shortcomings of these approaches in their failure to focus adequately on the changes in actions and beliefs of environmental subjects. Only feminist environmentalists (aside from scholars who focus on indigenous peoples) pay adequate attention to identity?with the drawback that their concern is strictly with gender.  Using carefully constructed arguments, Agrawal successfully achieves his purpose of creating a framework for environmental policy analysis. One only wishes the message was in a language and form that would easily draw in policy and advocacy readers, not just scholars. With all the talk of the ?death of environmentalism? within the American environmental movement these days, environmentalists would undoubtedly benefit from the important insights that Agrawal offers.  ?JOANNE BAUER, Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs",

         "description" : "[1. Contexte]\r\nCet ouvrage, rÃ©alisÃ© par la division Human Policy Group (HPG) de l\u2019institut indÃ©pendant Overseas Development Institute (ODS), sur commande du gouvernement britannique, a pour but de prÃ©senter les causes de l\u2019urbanisation de Khartoum et ses consÃ©quences sur la qualitÃ© de vie des populations locales, afin de proposer des recommandations aux dÃ©cideurs politiques dans le but d\u2019une action de la communautÃ© internationale pour amÃ©liorer la situation dans la capitale Soudanaise. On peut supposer que l\u2019intÃ©rÃªt du gouvernement britannique pour le Soudan dÃ©coule de l\u2019histoire de l\u2019empire britannique. En effet avant son indÃ©pendance en 1956, l\u2019actuel Soudan, qui avait dÃ©jÃ  Khartoum comme capitale, n\u2019Ã©tait autre qu\u2019un condominium Anglo-Egyptien.\r\n                       [2. Constat]\r\nKhartoum est caractÃ©risÃ© par une part une importante de la population vivant dans des camps de rÃ©fugiÃ©s ou des quartiers d\u2019habitat prÃ©caires, eux mÃªmes dÃ©finis par des conditions de vie difficile, une quasi absence d\u2019infrastructure de services urbains et une insÃ©curitÃ© fonciÃ¨re importante. La population pauvre de Khartoum reprÃ©sente 60% de la population totale de la ville.\r\n\r\n                 [3. Causes de l\u2019urbanisation et consÃ©quences pour la population]\r\n                                        [3.1) Histoire]\r\nDepuis sa crÃ©ation en 1821 comme avant poste de l\u2019armÃ©e Egyptienne, jusqu\u2019Ã  son accession au statut de capitale du condominium Anglo-Egyptien en 1899, les diffÃ©rentes autoritÃ©s en charge de Khartoum dÃ©veloppÃ¨rent la ville selon une logique sÃ©grÃ©gative et coloniale, divisant la ville en trois types de parcelles, chacune rÃ©servÃ©e Ã  un type de population (Ã©lites, classes moyennes, populations pauvres). De par son dÃ©veloppement Ã©conomique et les possibilitÃ©s qu\u2019elle offrait en terme d\u2019Ã©ducation, Khartoum attira les populations rurales du Soudan durant toute la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© du vingtiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle. Ces nouvelles populations se rÃ©partirent dans la mesure du possible selon la logique sÃ©grÃ©gative utilisÃ©e Ã  ce moment ou sinon commencÃ¨rent Ã  coloniser les terrains vierges, crÃ©ant ainsi des bidonvilles dans les interstices ou aux pÃ©riphÃ©ries.\r\nSi Khartoum a continuÃ© d\u2019Ãªtre le lieu de destination des populations rurales durant la seconde moitiÃ© du vingtiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle, c\u2019est pour des raisons bien plus tragiques. Depuis son indÃ©pendance en 1953, le Soudan a Ã©tÃ© le thÃ©Ã¢tre de nombreux conflits (guerres civiles) et catastrophes naturelles (famines) forÃ§ant les populations rurales du Soudan Ã  se dÃ©placer pour trouver refuge Ã  Khartoum. A cela on peut ajouter l\u2019exode, dÃ©coulant de conflits dans les pays limitrophes au Soudan (guerre civile d\u2019ErythrÃ©e) de nombreux Ethiopiens, ErythrÃ©ens et Somaliens vers Khartoum durant les annÃ©es 1960-1970. Les autoritÃ©s crÃ©Ã¨rent des camps pour accueillir ces populations, mais nombre de ces nouveaux immigrÃ©s choisirent de se loger dans les bidonvilles et quartiers informels. \r\n                          [3.2) Manque de suivi des autoritÃ©s et politiques dÃ©faillantes]\r\nLa situation actuelle peut aussi s\u2019expliquer par le manque de suivi des autoritÃ©s dans la planification de la capitale Soudanaise. De tous les plans stratÃ©giques nationaux rÃ©alisÃ©s durant le vingtiÃ¨me siÃ¨cle, aucun ne prit en compte la question de l\u2019urbanisation. De tous les plans directeurs commandÃ©s Ã  des organismes privÃ©s aprÃ¨s l\u2019indÃ©pendance, aucun ne fut mis en Åuvre par les autoritÃ©s. Les raisons d\u2019une absence de mise en Åuvre des plans directeurs peuvent Ãªtre par exemple l\u2019insuffisance de ressources financiÃ¨res de la part de la ville, la corruption ou encore un MOU pas assez explicite. Le premier plan directeur de Khartoum ne fut mis en oeuvre qu\u2019en 2007 et peut se rÃ©sumer Ã  une gouvernance chaotique et une absence de coordination entre les diffÃ©rents acteurs impliquÃ©s.\r\nComme nous l\u2019avons vu, les immigrÃ©s ayant rejoint Khartoum Ã  cause des conflits sÃ©vissant sur leurs terres d\u2019origine reprÃ©sentent une part importante de la population et les lois rÃ©gissant leurs droits peuvent Ãªtre tenues comme partiellement responsables du chaos rÃ©gnant Ã  Khartoum. Bien qu\u2019ayant la nationalitÃ© Soudanaise ces immigrÃ©s ne peuvent pas bÃ©nÃ©ficier de papiers d\u2019identitÃ© officiels, et par consÃ©quent sont dans l\u2019incapacitÃ© d\u2019occuper un emploi lÃ©gal. Ils voient paradoxalement les postes d\u2019ouvriers non qualifiÃ©s pris d\u2019assaut par les immigrÃ©s Ã©trangers, pour qui le gouvernement central a autorisÃ© le travail. \r\nFaute d\u2019adopter une vision stratÃ©gique et planificatrice, les autoritÃ©s ont entrepris des actions Â« Ã  l\u2019aveugle Â» de rÃ©amÃ©nagement des quartiers d\u2019habitat prÃ©caires et des camps d\u2019immigrÃ©s afin d\u2019attribuer des titres fonciers aux populations. Cependant, du Ã  l\u2019absence de stratÃ©gie et de registre (l\u2019allocation du terrain est basÃ© sur une date d\u2019arrivÃ© Ã  Khartoum), les autoritÃ©s ne garantissent pas l\u2019attribution systÃ©matique de terrain une fois les baraquements dÃ©molis lors de l\u2019opÃ©ration de rÃ©amÃ©nagement. Il est donc souvent arrivÃ© que des familles aient leur habitation dÃ©truite sans pour autant devenir propriÃ©taire de la parcelle. Dans ce cas ils doivent dÃ©mÃ©nager vers d\u2019autres quartiers d\u2019habitat prÃ©caire. C\u2019est un cercle vicieux qui est directement une consÃ©quence du manque de planification, elle mÃªme causÃ©e par des politiques publiques dÃ©faillantes.\r\nConcernant le dÃ©veloppement d\u2019infrastructures de services urbains, on constate d\u2019importantes lacunes. Certains quartiers d\u2019habitat prÃ©caires ne sont toujours pas Ã©quipÃ©s en station d\u2019Ã©puration des eaux, contraignant les populations Ã  acheter l\u2019eau Ã  des vendeurs d\u2019eau en barils. L\u2019achat d\u2019eau reprÃ©sente 40% des dÃ©penses journaliÃ¨res des mÃ©nages. En ce qui concerne les eaux usÃ©es, seulement 28% de la population de Khartoum est raccordÃ©e aux installations de traitement. Le gouvernement de local prÃ©voit l\u2019expansion des rÃ©seaux d\u2019eaux usÃ©es Ã  certains quartiers, mais en aucun cas n\u2019y incluent les quartiers d\u2019habitat prÃ©caire. Ici encore la planification de dÃ©veloppement des rÃ©seaux urbains laisse Ã  dÃ©sirer. L\u2019organisation de la collecte des dÃ©chets a aussi Ã©tÃ© dÃ©bordÃ©e par l\u2019urbanisation fulgurante de la capitale soudanaise. Sans parler de la collecte, on ne trouve mÃªme pas de poubelle dans les quartiers les plus pauvres de Khartoum, qui ont lÃ  encore Ã©tÃ© oubliÃ©s du plan de gestion des dÃ©chets dÃ©veloppÃ© par le gouvernement local en 2002. \r\n                                      [4. Conclusion]\r\nComme nous l\u2019avons vu le pattern d\u2019urbanisation date de l\u2019Ã©poque coloniale. Rien n\u2019a Ã©tÃ© fait par les autoritÃ©s pour changer ce mode d\u2019urbanisation. De plus, a cause de nombreux conflits au Soudan et dans les pays limitrophes, Khartoum a hÃ©ritÃ© de nombreux immigrants fuyant la guerre sur leurs terres d\u2019origine. Parce que rien n\u2019a Ã©tÃ© mis a disposition de ces immigrants, ces derniers se sont massÃ©s alors dans des camps sans infrastructures leur Ã©tant destinÃ©s ou ont choisi de rejoindre les quartiers informels d\u2019habitat prÃ©caire. Les autoritÃ©s continuent de planifier la ville sans prendre en compte ces quartiers, sans adopter de vision long terme ou plan stratÃ©gique et sans suivre un model de gouvernance bien Ã©tabli. Bien que la colonisation soit une des causes de la situation actuelle, le manque de rÃ©activitÃ© des autoritÃ©s a changer le systÃ¨me (car occupÃ©es a faire face a la guerre civile), y est Ã©galement pour beaucoup. Par exemple l\u2019environnement n\u2019est jamais pris e compte lors des opÃ©rations d\u2019amÃ©nagement. Ceci illustre un manque de planification Ã  l\u2019Ã©chelle locale mais Ã©galement Ã  l\u2019Ã©chelle nationale et le manque de coopÃ©ration entre les diffÃ©rents Ã©chelons. La prise en compte de l\u2019environnement se doit d\u2019Ãªtre chapeautÃ©e par des politiques nationales, des agendas 21, ainsi que des directives locales. On peut se douter que rien de cela n\u2019a Ã©tÃ© fait dans le cadre de Khartoum.\r\nOn peut par cet ouvrage Ã©galement comprendre l\u2019effet domino qui sÃ©vit lors de l\u2019absence de planification. Par exemple si le plan local des dÃ©chets n\u2019inclut pas les quartiers les plus pauvres, c\u2019est parce que ceux la ne sont pas Ã©quipÃ©s de routes goudronnÃ©es. La mauvaise planification sur une infrastructure en amont (route) provoque ainsi l\u2019impossibilitÃ© de planifier le dÃ©veloppement d\u2019infrastructures en aval.\r\nLe manque de planification a Ã©galement bÃ©nÃ©ficiÃ© au dÃ©veloppement de l\u2019informel. C\u2019est par ce biais que les populations les plus pauvres survivent, en consultant la Â« native administration Â» en bÃ©nÃ©ficiant d\u2019aides des ONG qui s\u2019appuient sur des rÃ©seaux informels ou encore via ceux ci directement (vente de produits pÃ©rimÃ©s, rÃ©seaux religieux, rÃ©ception d\u2019argent par les membres de la famille ayant fui Khartoum pour des pays plus prospÃ¨res). Le rÃ©seau informel est responsable de minimum 45% des emplois Ã  Khartoum et n\u2019est pas contrÃ´lÃ© par les autoritÃ©s. C\u2019est ainsi un cercle vicieux qui pÃ©nalise les autoritÃ©s comme l\u2019informel.\r\nDu a ces nouveaux patterns d\u2019urbanisation (quartier informels souvent densÃ©ment peuplÃ©s) de nouvelles pratiques sociales (monogamie, divorce, prÃ©fÃ©rence pour la mÃ©decine occidentale) apparaissent, transformant ainsi en profondeur la sociÃ©tÃ© soudanaise. Plus gÃ©nÃ©ralement il a Ã©tÃ© montrÃ© que l\u2019urbanisation a Ã©tÃ© responsable de changement sociÃ©taux en Afrique (Epstein , Gugler , Little ). Cet ouvrage montre parfaitement que l\u2019absence de planification peut Ãªtre tenue comme responsable des mutations opÃ©rant dans une sociÃ©tÃ©.  Les populations ne sont absolument pas impliquÃ©es dans le design et dÃ©veloppement des nouveaux plans d\u2019urbanisme. En d\u2019autres termes, elles ne sont pas impliquÃ©es dans la gouvernance. Pour Friedman , ne pas inclure les populations locales dans la gouvernance urbaine est une erreur couteuse\r\n\r\n[Bibliography]\r\nL.

Il fit en effet ce mï¿½moire, dans lequel il s'attacha principalement ï¿½ montrer en gï¿½nï¿½ral qu'une telle dï¿½couverte apporteroit rï¿½ellement beaucoup de gloire ï¿½ la nation, & de grandes utilitï¿½s ï¿½ son commerce.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. I-II)\r\n\r\nAmerikainteresse\r\nToute la partie mï¿½ridionale de notre globe est encore inconnue.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 2)\r\n\r\nAmerikainteresse\r\n... au lieu que dans le nouveau monde austral, sï¿½parï¿½ de tout commerce avec l'ancien, & oï¿½ l'on peut assurer que les navigations en pleine mer sont absoluement inconnues, on doit trouver un nouveau genre de choses tout-ï¿½-fait neuf, des branches entiï¿½res d'un nouveau commerce, & de merveilleux spectacles physiques & moraux.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 3)\r\n\r\nReiseliteratur\r\nVainement on lui reprï¿½senta qu'il y avoit plus de choses lï¿½-dessus qu'il ne le pensoit, & qu'on ne le croyoit communï¿½ment; mais qu'elles ï¿½toient noyï¿½es dans une foule de recueils immenses, en langues latine, espagnole, angloise & hollandoise, oï¿½ personne ne s'avisoit de les aller chercher; dans une quantitï¿½ de routiers trï¿½s-secs, trï¿½s-ennuyeux, rï¿½latifs sic ï¿½ cent autres objets, & dont il seroit presque impossible de rendre la lecture intï¿½ressante.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. III)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nIl fallut se rendre, surtout ï¿½ la considï¿½ration que les connoissances qu'on trouveroit ici rassemblï¿½es pourroient un jour servir de | quelque chose ï¿½ notre nation, pour en acquerir sic de plus grandes & de meilleures sur ce monde inconnu, lorsqu'elle aura pris le parti de tourner en entier ses vues du cï¿½tï¿½ de la marine; de mettre ses soins & sa dï¿½pense principale ï¿½ entretenir des flottes nombreuses de guerre & de commerce; comme il est ï¿½vident qu'elle doit s'y porter avec ardeur pour son propre intï¿½rï¿½t, & mï¿½me par nï¿½cessitï¿½ dans l'ï¿½tat actuel du systï¿½me sic politique de l'Europe, dans un tems oï¿½ une puissance voisine affecte visiblement la monarchie universelle de la mer, sans ï¿½gard ni mï¿½nagement pour aucune autre nation.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. III-IV)\r\n\r\nMotive\r\nL'entreprise la plus grande, la plus noble, la plus utile peut-ï¿½tre que puisse faire un souverain, la plus capable d'illustrer ï¿½ | jamais son nom, est la dï¿½couverte des //Terres australes//.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 4-5)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nIci la grandeur de l'objet se trouve jointe aux utilitï¿½s de la rï¿½ussite. Augmenter la terre d'un nouveau monde: enrichir l'ancien monde de toutes les productions naturelles, de tous les usages utiles du nouveau; voilï¿½ quel seroit l'effet d'une telle dï¿½couverte. Quelle comparaison pourroit-on faire entre l'ï¿½xecution d'un pareil projet, & la conquï¿½te quelquefois injuste, de quelque petit pai(mit Trema)s ravagï¿½; de deux ou trois forteresses ruinï¿½es par le canon, acquises par le massacre, la ruine, la dï¿½solation  & les regrets du peuple vainqueur, aussi-bien que du peuple vaincu; achetï¿½e au prix d'une dï¿½pense cent fois plus grande que celle qui seroit nï¿½cessaire pour l'entiï¿½re dï¿½couverte proposï¿½e? Parmi les souverains des derniers siï¿½cles y en a-t-il un seul qui  osï¿½t comparer sa gloire ï¿½ celle de Christophe Colomb?\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 5)\r\n\r\nStruktur\r\nOn a prï¿½fï¿½rï¿½ de suivre l'ordre des tems & des navigations , plï¿½tï¿½t sic que de donner une description ï¿½ part de chaque contrï¿½e particuliï¿½re.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. VI)\r\n\r\nImagotypen\r\nLa conquï¿½te de l'Amï¿½rique par les Castillans, & leur frï¿½quentes navigations vers ces pai(mit Trema)s ï¿½loignï¿½s, d'oï¿½ ils apportoient l'or & l'argent avec profusion, les mirent bientï¿½t en ï¿½tat de maï¿½triser toute l'Europe; & peu s'en fallut que leur roi ne parvint ï¿½ la monarchie universelle, avec le secours des richesses du nouveau monde. (Teil der Fu\\\"ssnote)\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 8)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nCes exemples & plusieurs autres doivent encourager aux dï¿½couvertes & ï¿½ la navigation, ceux d'entre les princes chrï¿½tiens qui paroissent avoir nï¿½gligï¿½ cet art & peu affectionnï¿½ les dï¿½couvertes. (Teil der Fu\\\"ssnote)\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 8)\r\n\r\nStruktur\r\n... aprï¿½s quoi il en compose une narration suivie, oï¿½ le navigateur parle presque toujours lui-mï¿½me ï¿½ la premiï¿½re personne, comme s'il eut ainsi ï¿½crit d'un seul fil: car on supprime ici une infinitï¿½ de choses intermï¿½diaires, en un mot tout ce qui n'est pas rï¿½cit des Terres australes.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. VIII)\r\n\r\nRezeption\r\nIl falloit avoir un peu d'ï¿½gard ici pour le lecteur ordinaire en | lui ï¿½pargnant quelque chose de l'inutile & intolï¿½rable ennui de tant de dï¿½tails si arides.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. VIII-IX)\r\n\r\nMotive\r\nNe songeons d'abord qu'ï¿½ la gï¿½ographie, ï¿½ la pure curiositï¿½ de dï¿½couvrir, d'acquï¿½rir ï¿½ l'univers de nouvelles terres, de nouveaux habitans.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 9)\r\n\r\nRezeption\r\nLes marins ï¿½crivent mal, mais avec assez de candeur. Ce n'est pas l'ï¿½lï¿½gance du style que l'on recherche en un pareil ouvrage; c'est l'instruction dans les faits & la connoissance des choses ignorï¿½es. Le lecteur les veut peintes telles que le navigateur les a vues, non avec le coloris dont la plume de l'historien pourroit les orner.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. IX)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nLes Franï¿½ois nï¿½anmoins oublians dï¿½s le lendemain ce hasard heureux d'une entreprise si mï¿½morable, en ont, par leur lï¿½gï¿½retï¿½ naturelle, perdu tous les avantages; & non contens de ne pas suivre avec constance ce qu'une semblable fortu-|ne sembloit leur promettre, ils se sont laissï¿½ dï¿½rober par les Espagnols & par les Portugais tout l'honneur de la premiï¿½re dï¿½couverte.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 10-11)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nA dire vrai, pour rï¿½ussir ï¿½ la dï¿½couverte complette des //Terres australes//, il ne faut avoir d'autre but que celui de rï¿½ussir: il faut y employer les moyens convenables, & des forces suffisantes: ce qu'un puissant souverain, dont l'esprit a de grandes vï¿½es, dont les ministres sont ï¿½clairï¿½s, dont les ï¿½tats sont avantageusement situï¿½s sur les deux mers, dont les ï¿½tablissements sont dï¿½jï¿½ considï¿½rables au-delï¿½ de l'ï¿½quateur, peut facilement faire | avec une dï¿½pense infiniment moins grande & mieux placï¿½e que celle d'une guerre infructueuse, qui coï¿½te tant de millinos d'or & tant de milliers d'hommes.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 11-12)\r\n\r\nReiseliteratur\r\nIl faut enfin ne pas beaucoup s'occuper, jusqu'ï¿½ la pleine rï¿½ussite, des utilitï¿½s qu'on peut en recueillir; elles se prï¿½senteront assez d'elles-mï¿½mes ï¿½ la suite.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 12)\r\n\r\nMotive\r\nIl y a sans doute, dans tous les genres, des milliers d'espï¿½ces dont nous n'avons pas mï¿½me de notion, puique ce monde n'a jamias eu aucune communication avec le notre, & qu'il nous est, pour ainsi dire, presqu'aussi ï¿½tranger que pourroit l'ï¿½tre une autre planette: c'est un spectacle tout neuf. ... Ce qu'il y a d'heureux, c'est qu'un tel marchï¿½ seroit ï¿½galement profitable aux deux parties commerï¿½antes. Le fer est un trï¿½sor de notre Europe fort au-dessus de l'or des Indes, & le premier des mï¿½taux sans doute, puisqu'il est le plus utile.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 16)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nLa police qu'ils nous verroient observer, & les avantages ï¿½videns qui rï¿½sultent d'une sociï¿½tï¿½ bien reglï¿½e, les porteroient sans doute ï¿½ l'imiter, adouciroient leurs mï¿½urs sauvages, & feroient ï¿½ la fin des hommes de tant d'ï¿½tres qui n'en ont que la figure. On ne peut croire que les Indiens fussent restï¿½s jusqu'ï¿½ prï¿½sent dans leur nature brute ï¿½ la vï¿½e des Espagnols, si les mauvais traitemens dont ceux-ci les ont accablï¿½s, ne les avoit sagement portï¿½s ï¿½ s'ï¿½carter d'eux autant qu'il est possible. Mais ï¿½ supposer que par une fortune ï¿½gale ï¿½ celle que Christophe Colomb a procurï¿½e ï¿½ nos voisins, nous venions jamais ï¿½ faire la dï¿½couverte complette du monde austral, leur exemple nous servira d'instruction: nous ï¿½viterons les deux vices qu'eurent alors les Espagnols, l'avarice & la cruautï¿½. L'une a dï¿½peuplï¿½ leur propre pays par l'aviditï¿½ d'une fortune chimï¿½rique qui ne se doit pas faire ainsi. L'autre dont l'orgueil & la superstition nationale furent les sources, a dï¿½truit l'espï¿½ce humaine en Amï¿½rique, a ï¿½gorgï¿½ avec dï¿½dain, comme de vils animaux d'une autre couleur, des millions d'Indiens dont ils auroient pï¿½ faire des hommes; a dï¿½truit jusqu'au der- | nier de la race de cent nations, comme s'il y avoit quelque profit ï¿½ faire dans la propriï¿½tï¿½ d'un pays qui manque d'habitans.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 17-18)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nLa police qu'ils nous verroient observer, & les avantages ï¿½videns qui rï¿½sultent d'une sociï¿½tï¿½ bien reglï¿½e, les porteroient sans doute ï¿½ l'imiter, adouciroient leurs moeurs (korr.!!!) sauvages, & feroient ï¿½ la fin des hommes de tant d'ï¿½tres qui n'en ont que la figure. On ne peut croire que les Indiens fussent restï¿½s jusqu'ï¿½ prï¿½sent dans leur nature brute ï¿½ la vï¿½e des Espagnols, si les mauvais traitemens dont ceux-ci les ont accablï¿½s, ne les avoit sagement portï¿½s ï¿½ s'ï¿½carter d'eux autant qu'il est possible.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 17)\r\n\r\nImagotypen\r\n... nous ï¿½viterons les deux vices qu'eurent alors les Espagnols, l'avarice & la cruautï¿½.

Ils en tirent, dit-on, un profit immense pour leur ordre; si cela est, on ne peut que les louer davantage d'avoir sï¿½ï¿½ si bien allier leur utilitï¿½ avec le bonheur d'autrui.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 18)\r\n\r\nReligion\r\nNe cessons point de donner ï¿½ ses travaux si glorieux  & si pï¿½nibles, tous les ï¿½loges qu'ils mï¿½ritent. Il seroit ï¿½ souhaiter que quelqu'ordre religieux prit le parti de se consacrer uniquement & entiï¿½rement ï¿½ un pareil ouvrage: c'est par-lï¿½ surtout qu'il se montreroit vraiment religieux envers Dieu & envers les hommes, en s'occupant d'abord | ï¿½ rassembler les Sauvages isolï¿½s & dispersï¿½s dans les bois, ï¿½ les rï¿½unir dans une mï¿½me habitation, ï¿½ leur faire goï¿½ter les avantages des loix humaines & de la sociï¿½tï¿½, ï¿½ les instruire des vertus morales; pour pouvoir ensuite les amener par degrï¿½s ï¿½ la connoissance encore plus importante des vï¿½ritï¿½s du christianisme; car en pareil cas, il faut ï¿½tre chef de colonie avant que d'ï¿½tre apï¿½tre, & mï¿½me pour pouvoir un jour parvenir ï¿½ l'ï¿½tre avec un succï¿½s durable.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 18-19)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nTout autre peuple peut y arriver comme nous.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 20)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nY a-t-il quelqu'emploi plus digne des hommes que celui de former & de dï¿½velopper leur propre espece?\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 20)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nCe que nous sï¿½avons des insulaires de la mer pacifique, nous montre qu'ils ne manque ni d'adresse ni d'intelligence. ... il ne s'est rencontrï¿½ que des hommes tout-ï¿½-fait barbares; ...\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 20)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nQuand nous ne trouverions chez les Australiens que quelque chose ï¿½ peu prï¿½s pareille au Mï¿½xique et au Pï¿½rou, ce seroit dï¿½jï¿½ beaucoup: sans doute que nous ne dï¿½truirions pas leurs monumens & leurs travaux, comme ont fait les Espagnols chez les deux peuples que je viens de nommer.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 21)\r\n\r\nAnthropologie\r\nEn Amï¿½rique au milieu de tant d'hommes qui n'ï¿½toient que des espï¿½ces de vï¿½gï¿½taux, on a trouvï¿½ dans deux contrï¿½es fort distantes l'une de l'autre, les peuples du Mï¿½xique & ceux du Pï¿½rou trï¿½s-supï¿½rieurs ï¿½ tous les autres.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 21)\r\n\r\nNation\r\n... il se trouve encore des gens qui ne voyent dans les choses, & surtout dans les nouveaux projets, que l'abus qu'on en peut faire. Ils diront que le grand nombre des colonie affoiblissent un ï¿½tat ...\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 22)\r\n\r\nImagotypen\r\nLe mal n'a pas ï¿½tï¿½ de faire des ï¿½tablissements en Amï¿½rique, mais de les faire ainsi sans rï¿½glesic, sans politique, sans mï¿½nagement; d'avoir voulu envahir ce qu'il ï¿½toit ï¿½vident qu'on ne pouvoit occuper, dï¿½- | truire ce qu'on ne pouvoit remplacer, & conquï¿½rir plus qu'il n'ï¿½toit possible de possï¿½der.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 22-23)\r\n\r\nImagotypen\r\nOn peut comparer ce tems des conquï¿½tes des Espagnols ï¿½ celui des croisades, & ï¿½ celui de la fortune du papier en France. Il n'est pas difficile de se rï¿½former sur un tel ï¿½xemple sic, comme les Hollandois l'ont fait avec succï¿½s & avec une extrï¿½me habiletï¿½ de conduite. Les fautes des siï¿½cles passï¿½s sont transmises ï¿½ la postï¿½ritï¿½ pour son instruction, & c'est la principale utilitï¿½ qu'on retire de l'ï¿½tude de l'histoire.\r\n(Brosses 1756, S. 23)\r\n\r\nNation\r\nOn peut calculer la puissance d'un royaume par sa population, & prï¿½dire son augmentation future en raison  des soins qu'on s'y donne pour la propagation de l'espï¿½ce humaine; des secours que l'on rï¿½pand sur ceux ï¿½ qui l'ï¿½tat est redevable d'un certain nombre d'enfans; du libre cours que l'on laisse au pen- | chant naturel des deu",
