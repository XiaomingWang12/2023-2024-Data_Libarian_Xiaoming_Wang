Humanist Historical Research and Apocalypticism: Hungarian Relations in Johannes L\u00f6wenklau\u2019s Historia Musulmanae Turcorum (1591)\r\nThe present paper is about the Turkish Histories (Annales Sultanorum Othmanidarum 1588; Neuwer musulmanischer Histori t\u00fcrckischer Nation, 1590; Historiae Musulmanae Turcorum, 1591) written by Hans L\u00f6wenklau (Joannes Leunclavius). The German humanist was one of the best orientalists of the 16th century. Firstly he provided a good Ottoman History for a western audience on the basis of the original Turkish histories. He had a number of Hungarian relations. He took a part in the war against the Turks in Hungary in 1594. Then he died some weeks later in Vienna. He was a Calvinist (or Crypto-Calvinist) having good connections with the freethinkers of the contemporary Republic of Letters. All his writings were put on the Roman Index. He used for his works Hungarian sources: the so-called Codex Verantius and the Codex Hanivaldanus. While the first of these manuscripts belonged to the famous Hungarian humanist Antal Verancsics (Antonius Verantius), the other one was more striking: it had been translated to Latin by Tarjuman Murad alias Bal\u00e1zs Somlyai, a Hungarian-born chief interpreter at the Ottoman Porte.","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","45":"","46":"","47":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","48":"","49":"","50":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","89":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","90":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","99":"","100":"","101":"HEIDI","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","108":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"","114":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","115":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","116":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","117":"","118":"","119":"","120":"","121":"","122":"","123":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","124":"","125":"","126":"","127":"","128":"","129":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","130":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","131":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","132":"","133":"","134":"","135":"","136":"","137":"","138":"","139":"","140":"","141":"","142":"","143":"","144":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","145":"","146":"","147":"","148":"","149":"","150":"","151":"","152":"","153":"","154":"","155":"","156":"","157":"","158":"","159":"","160":"","161":"","162":"","163":"","164":"","165":"","166":"","167":"","168":"","169":"","170":"","171":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","172":"","173":"","174":"","175":"","176":"","177":"","178":"","179":"","180":"","181":"","182":"","183":"","184":"","185":"","186":"","187":"","188":"","189":"","190":"","191":"","192":"","193":"","194":"","195":"","196":"","197":"","198":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","199":"","200":"","201":"","202":"","203":"","204":"","205":"","206":"","207":"","208":"","209":"","210":"","211":"","212":"","213":"","214":"","215":"","216":"","217":"","218":"","219":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","220":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","221":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","222":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","223":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","224":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","225":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","226":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","227":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","228":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","229":"","230":"","231":"","232":"","233":"","234":"","235":"","236":"","237":"","238":"","239":"","240":"","241":"","242":"","243":"","244":"","245":"","246":"","247":"","248":"","249":"","250":"","251":"","252":"","253":"","254":"","255":"","256":"","257":"","258":"","259":"","260":"","261":"","262":"","263":"","264":"","265":"","266":"","267":"","268":"","269":"","270":"","271":"","272":"","273":"","274":"","275":"","276":"","277":"","278":"","279":"","280":"","281":"","282":"","283":"","284":"","285":"","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"","290":"","291":"","292":"","293":"","294":"","295":"","296":"","297":"","298":"","299":"","300":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","301":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","302":"","303":"","304":"","305":"","306":"","307":"","308":"","309":"","310":"","311":"","312":"","313":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","314":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","315":"Wujastyk's main bibtex file, April 30, 2010","316":"","317":"","318":"A leading centre for anthropological teaching and research in the UK","319":"","320":"","321":"","322":"","323":"","324":"","325":"Searchable, multilingual database of anthropological texts","326":"RT @JohnPostill: Presentation notes: \"Free culture activism and social media in Barcelona\" http:\/\/wp.me\/p1dND-1ms","327":"","328":"Tutorial guide through the main research methodologies in Social science including -

In fifteenth-century Ragusa (present-day Dubrovnik) membership of the Great Council, which nominated and elected office-holders, was restricted to the legitimate male offspring of patrician brides and grooms. The patrician class was highlyendogamous, and the relationship between endogamy and electoral support is an important theme running through this book. A related theme concerns the age differences between spouses, which are shown to have important structural implications for the organization of the casata, kinship relations, andmarriage ties.

Also Moser is a lecturer in the University of Manchester and an academic specialising in social policy and urban anthropology in gender perspective. She introduces her book explaining how important is the problem of violence in the cities now, especially if we are talking about women. This the example of Ecuador she explains that if the streets are not safe for women, the city itself limitates life opportunities for women providing their social isolation. Moser argues the not static nature of urban violence which face is rapidly changing and propose to analyze violence as a multi-layered concept. To achieve this goal she points out the necessity to make a \u201cskeleton\u201d of urban violence: define multiple forms of violence, identify trends and characteristics, find causes and consequences and search for different types of interventions to reduce violence on different levels. The same challenges facing all urban researchers which articles are included in the book. \r\n\r\nI decided to concentrate on one article that treats the theme of security and fear in urban spaces in South Africa with the title \u00abA new apartheid? The spatial implications of fear of crime in Cape Town, South Africa\u00bb by Charlotte Lemanski. The author of the article - Charlotte Lemanski - is a lecturer in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge. She concentrate her researches on the urban realities of South Africa analyzing concepts of gentrification, security, governance, integration in the patterns of cities. Lemanski worked with children in South Africa and made her doctoral research about social integration in post-apartheid Cape Town. \r\n\r\nThe research of Charlotte Lemanski was made in the context of the statistic of an alarming increase in serious crime over recent years that decreases security in South Africa. This article focuses specifically on Cape Town. Lemanski consider that \u00abfear of crime is spatially, socially and temporally distributed\u00bb and in this conditions the sense of protection that is needed by citizens is expressed via urban forms. Lemanski operates with the concepts of \u00abspatial response\u00bb and \u00abrisk management\u00bb to show how the emotions (fear, in this case) change the city landscape. \r\n\r\nIn the history of urbanism fear was always presented as influencing city planning and here Lemanski shows the examples of pre-modern city constructed walls and gates, \u201cpanoptic\u201d prison design for anonymous surveillance of prisoners and even Haussman\u2019s Parisian reconstruction that was guided by the fear of the new revolution. Nowadays new cities are planned concerning the strategies to minimize the sense of insecurity for the citizens but citizens have their own individual response to the fear.\r\n\r\nLemanski argues that the urban practices in Cape Town make a kind of spiral development and come back again to residential segregation but now these changes are not race-based but a result of a constant sense of fear. The end of apartheid were seen as an end the violence in South Africa, but since 1990 a new wave of urban criminal activity is spreading into previously protected white suburbs. The statistics of 2002 indicate that although violent crime is decreasing, robbery and residential burglary are increasing. Despite reductions in some crime levels, one-third of crimes in South Africa are violent. Regarding sociospatial distribution of institutional resources not all citizens of Cape Town are protected equally: despite lower crime rates in former white areas, they host the majority of police stations, and inhabitants are more protected by infrastructure (e.g. private cars, street lighting) and better able to afford private security. In contrast, poorer blacks inhabit areas with weak \u201cdefensible space\u201d (e.g. no street lighting or telephones, abandoned open spaces), are poorly policed and cannot afford private security. This spatial distribution of victimization and resources strongly affects fear of crime. \r\n\r\nThe fear presents as a common sense in Cape Town: in 1998 only 28% of Capetonians felt \u201cvery safe\u201d in their daytime residential area compared to almost 60% in the nation as a whole. In the absence of urban controls citizens are responding independently on this insecurity and fear-provoked residential fortification is common to both poor and wealthy even if the practices are not equal for different social groups. To avoid crime South Africans not only use basic strategies such as dogs, window grilles and high fences but also fortifying entire neighbourhoods, closing street access, erecting electrified fences and high walls, as well as employing private security guards and CCTV to patrol and monitor their citadels. This desire for maximum security has led to numerous illegally enclosed neighbourhoods and the authorities can\u2019t control the process so fast. \r\n\r\nAs a result enclosing neighbourhoods have had a perverse effect, leaving both public and private spaces devoid of natural surveillance and thereby less safe. The sense of insecurity in the city has divided black and white people, rich and poor by creating a \u00abtribal territorialism\u00bb that served to increase fears and deepen segregation. Replacing public space with private space made a decline in public order while segregation encouraged the polarization of social groups in distinct universes. These enclaves deepen the segregation and reinforce fear by excluding difference and limiting social mixing, thus increasing paranoia and mistrust between groups. These enclaves deepen the segregation and reinforce fear by excluding difference and limiting social mixing promoting escapist mentalities (here author shoes good example with the frase \u201cnot in my back yard\u201d).\r\n\r\nCharlotte Lemanski concludes that \u00abhigh walls, dogs, armed guards and enclosed neighbourhoods have not brought peace of mind but have reproduced fears (via \u00abtalk of crime\u00bb), as homogenous groups are sociospatially distanced from their \u00abother\u00bb. She claims that these fear-provoked practices are similar to urban apartheid as the apartheid encouraged all races to consider themselves separate nations with distinct physical boundaries. But now these boundaries are more than real and they make Cape Town a \u00abcity of exclusions, not inclusions\u00bb. As an alternative solution she proposes the reconciliation of urban planning and citizen needs in order to embrace diversity and combat symbolic exclusionism. But for Lemanski it can happen only if we admit sociospatial nature of fear. \r\n\r\nFor me this article is interesting because it evokes the relation between the space and the sentiment. We live in the city and we use urban spaces but we have a sense of each space, an emotion with is related with every practice made in this space. In my specialization \u00abGeography and Gender\u00bb we use the concept of \u00abspace of fear\u00bb that helps to analyze how women use urban spaces including through their feelings of space, their subjective perception of the space. Unfortunately, Charlotte Lemanski doesn\u2019t work in gender perspective but for urban planning studying her approach can be very interesting. \r\n ","484":"","485":"[1.

Constat]\r\nKhartoum est caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par une part une importante de la population vivant dans des camps de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s ou des quartiers d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caires, eux m\u00eames d\u00e9finis par des conditions de vie difficile, une quasi absence d\u2019infrastructure de services urbains et une ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re importante. La population pauvre de Khartoum repr\u00e9sente 60% de la population totale de la ville.\r\n\r\n                 [3. Causes de l\u2019urbanisation et cons\u00e9quences pour la population]\r\n                                        [3.1) Histoire]\r\nDepuis sa cr\u00e9ation en 1821 comme avant poste de l\u2019arm\u00e9e Egyptienne, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son accession au statut de capitale du condominium Anglo-Egyptien en 1899, les diff\u00e9rentes autorit\u00e9s en charge de Khartoum d\u00e9velopp\u00e8rent la ville selon une logique s\u00e9gr\u00e9gative et coloniale, divisant la ville en trois types de parcelles, chacune r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 un type de population (\u00e9lites, classes moyennes, populations pauvres). De par son d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et les possibilit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle offrait en terme d\u2019\u00e9ducation, Khartoum attira les populations rurales du Soudan durant toute la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle. Ces nouvelles populations se r\u00e9partirent dans la mesure du possible selon la logique s\u00e9gr\u00e9gative utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment ou sinon commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 coloniser les terrains vierges, cr\u00e9ant ainsi des bidonvilles dans les interstices ou aux p\u00e9riph\u00e9ries.\r\nSi Khartoum a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre le lieu de destination des populations rurales durant la seconde moiti\u00e9 du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, c\u2019est pour des raisons bien plus tragiques. Depuis son ind\u00e9pendance en 1953, le Soudan a \u00e9t\u00e9 le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de nombreux conflits (guerres civiles) et catastrophes naturelles (famines) for\u00e7ant les populations rurales du Soudan \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer pour trouver refuge \u00e0 Khartoum. A cela on peut ajouter l\u2019exode, d\u00e9coulant de conflits dans les pays limitrophes au Soudan (guerre civile d\u2019Erythr\u00e9e) de nombreux Ethiopiens, Erythr\u00e9ens et Somaliens vers Khartoum durant les ann\u00e9es 1960-1970. Les autorit\u00e9s cr\u00e9\u00e8rent des camps pour accueillir ces populations, mais nombre de ces nouveaux immigr\u00e9s choisirent de se loger dans les bidonvilles et quartiers informels. \r\n                          [3.2) Manque de suivi des autorit\u00e9s et politiques d\u00e9faillantes]\r\nLa situation actuelle peut aussi s\u2019expliquer par le manque de suivi des autorit\u00e9s dans la planification de la capitale Soudanaise. De tous les plans strat\u00e9giques nationaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s durant le vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, aucun ne prit en compte la question de l\u2019urbanisation. De tous les plans directeurs command\u00e9s \u00e0 des organismes priv\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance, aucun ne fut mis en \u0153uvre par les autorit\u00e9s. Les raisons d\u2019une absence de mise en \u0153uvre des plans directeurs peuvent \u00eatre par exemple l\u2019insuffisance de ressources financi\u00e8res de la part de la ville, la corruption ou encore un MOU pas assez explicite. Le premier plan directeur de Khartoum ne fut mis en oeuvre qu\u2019en 2007 et peut se r\u00e9sumer \u00e0 une gouvernance chaotique et une absence de coordination entre les diff\u00e9rents acteurs impliqu\u00e9s.\r\nComme nous l\u2019avons vu, les immigr\u00e9s ayant rejoint Khartoum \u00e0 cause des conflits s\u00e9vissant sur leurs terres d\u2019origine repr\u00e9sentent une part importante de la population et les lois r\u00e9gissant leurs droits peuvent \u00eatre tenues comme partiellement responsables du chaos r\u00e9gnant \u00e0 Khartoum. Bien qu\u2019ayant la nationalit\u00e9 Soudanaise ces immigr\u00e9s ne peuvent pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de papiers d\u2019identit\u00e9 officiels, et par cons\u00e9quent sont dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper un emploi l\u00e9gal. Ils voient paradoxalement les postes d\u2019ouvriers non qualifi\u00e9s pris d\u2019assaut par les immigr\u00e9s \u00e9trangers, pour qui le gouvernement central a autoris\u00e9 le travail. \r\nFaute d\u2019adopter une vision strat\u00e9gique et planificatrice, les autorit\u00e9s ont entrepris des actions \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019aveugle \u00bb de r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement des quartiers d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caires et des camps d\u2019immigr\u00e9s afin d\u2019attribuer des titres fonciers aux populations. Cependant, du \u00e0 l\u2019absence de strat\u00e9gie et de registre (l\u2019allocation du terrain est bas\u00e9 sur une date d\u2019arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Khartoum), les autorit\u00e9s ne garantissent pas l\u2019attribution syst\u00e9matique de terrain une fois les baraquements d\u00e9molis lors de l\u2019op\u00e9ration de r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement. Il est donc souvent arriv\u00e9 que des familles aient leur habitation d\u00e9truite sans pour autant devenir propri\u00e9taire de la parcelle. Dans ce cas ils doivent d\u00e9m\u00e9nager vers d\u2019autres quartiers d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caire. C\u2019est un cercle vicieux qui est directement une cons\u00e9quence du manque de planification, elle m\u00eame caus\u00e9e par des politiques publiques d\u00e9faillantes.\r\nConcernant le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019infrastructures de services urbains, on constate d\u2019importantes lacunes. Certains quartiers d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caires ne sont toujours pas \u00e9quip\u00e9s en station d\u2019\u00e9puration des eaux, contraignant les populations \u00e0 acheter l\u2019eau \u00e0 des vendeurs d\u2019eau en barils. L\u2019achat d\u2019eau repr\u00e9sente 40% des d\u00e9penses journali\u00e8res des m\u00e9nages. En ce qui concerne les eaux us\u00e9es, seulement 28% de la population de Khartoum est raccord\u00e9e aux installations de traitement. Le gouvernement de local pr\u00e9voit l\u2019expansion des r\u00e9seaux d\u2019eaux us\u00e9es \u00e0 certains quartiers, mais en aucun cas n\u2019y incluent les quartiers d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caire. Ici encore la planification de d\u00e9veloppement des r\u00e9seaux urbains laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. L\u2019organisation de la collecte des d\u00e9chets a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bord\u00e9e par l\u2019urbanisation fulgurante de la capitale soudanaise. Sans parler de la collecte, on ne trouve m\u00eame pas de poubelle dans les quartiers les plus pauvres de Khartoum, qui ont l\u00e0 encore \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9s du plan de gestion des d\u00e9chets d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par le gouvernement local en 2002. \r\n                                      [4. Conclusion]\r\nComme nous l\u2019avons vu le pattern d\u2019urbanisation date de l\u2019\u00e9poque coloniale. Rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les autorit\u00e9s pour changer ce mode d\u2019urbanisation. De plus, a cause de nombreux conflits au Soudan et dans les pays limitrophes, Khartoum a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de nombreux immigrants fuyant la guerre sur leurs terres d\u2019origine. Parce que rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis a disposition de ces immigrants, ces derniers se sont mass\u00e9s alors dans des camps sans infrastructures leur \u00e9tant destin\u00e9s ou ont choisi de rejoindre les quartiers informels d\u2019habitat pr\u00e9caire. Les autorit\u00e9s continuent de planifier la ville sans prendre en compte ces quartiers, sans adopter de vision long terme ou plan strat\u00e9gique et sans suivre un model de gouvernance bien \u00e9tabli. Bien que la colonisation soit une des causes de la situation actuelle, le manque de r\u00e9activit\u00e9 des autorit\u00e9s a changer le syst\u00e8me (car occup\u00e9es a faire face a la guerre civile), y est \u00e9galement pour beaucoup. Par exemple l\u2019environnement n\u2019est jamais pris e compte lors des op\u00e9rations d\u2019am\u00e9nagement. Ceci illustre un manque de planification \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle locale mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale et le manque de coop\u00e9ration entre les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9chelons. La prise en compte de l\u2019environnement se doit d\u2019\u00eatre chapeaut\u00e9e par des politiques nationales, des agendas 21, ainsi que des directives locales. On peut se douter que rien de cela n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cadre de Khartoum.\r\nOn peut par cet ouvrage \u00e9galement comprendre l\u2019effet domino qui s\u00e9vit lors de l\u2019absence de planification. Par exemple si le plan local des d\u00e9chets n\u2019inclut pas les quartiers les plus pauvres, c\u2019est parce que ceux la ne sont pas \u00e9quip\u00e9s de routes goudronn\u00e9es. La mauvaise planification sur une infrastructure en amont (route) provoque ainsi l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de planifier le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019infrastructures en aval.\r\nLe manque de planification a \u00e9galement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 au d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019informel. C\u2019est par ce biais que les populations les plus pauvres survivent, en consultant la \u00ab native administration \u00bb en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant d\u2019aides des ONG qui s\u2019appuient sur des r\u00e9seaux informels ou encore via ceux ci directement (vente de produits p\u00e9rim\u00e9s, r\u00e9seaux religieux, r\u00e9ception d\u2019argent par les membres de la famille ayant fui Khartoum pour des pays plus prosp\u00e8res). Le r\u00e9seau informel est responsable de minimum 45% des emplois \u00e0 Khartoum et n\u2019est pas contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s. C\u2019est ainsi un cercle vicieux qui p\u00e9nalise les autorit\u00e9s comme l\u2019informel.\r\nDu a ces nouveaux patterns d\u2019urbanisation (quartier informels souvent dens\u00e9ment peupl\u00e9s) de nouvelles pratiques sociales (monogamie, divorce, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la m\u00e9decine occidentale) apparaissent, transformant ainsi en profondeur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 soudanaise. Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement il a \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9 que l\u2019urbanisation a \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable de changement soci\u00e9taux en Afrique (Epstein , Gugler , Little ). Cet ouvrage montre parfaitement que l\u2019absence de planification peut \u00eatre tenue comme responsable des mutations op\u00e9rant dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9.  Les populations ne sont absolument pas impliqu\u00e9es dans le design et d\u00e9veloppement des nouveaux plans d\u2019urbanisme. En d\u2019autres termes, elles ne sont pas impliqu\u00e9es dans la gouvernance. Pour Friedman , ne pas inclure les populations locales dans la gouvernance urbaine est une erreur couteuse\r\n\r\n[Bibliography]\r\nL.

The fantasy of an inscrutable East, she argues, is not merely a side note to film history, but rather a kernel of otherness that has shaped Hollywood cinema at its core. Through close readings of The Lady from Shanghai, Chinatown, Blade Runner, Lost in Translation, and other films, she develops a theory of the \u201cShanghai gesture,\u201d a trope whereby orientalist curios and d\u00e9cor become saturated with mystery. These objects and signs come to bear the burden of explanation for riddles that escape the Western protagonist or cannot be otherwise resolved by the plot.

She argues for the development of a process of cultural \u201cde-translation\u201d aimed at both untangling the psychic enigmas prompting the initial desire to separate the familiar from the foreign, and heightening attentiveness to the internal alterities underlying Western subjectivity.","44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":"The first mention of tea begins to be found in the literature of Russian orientalists from the second half of the 18th century.

Fagus sylvatica L., one of the most common Central European deciduous tree species showed symptoms of crown damage, a reduction in growth and increased mortality following the severe recent drought years. For Germany Fagus orientalis Lipsky, a closely related species with higher drought tolerance, originating from south-eastern Europe, Turkey, the Greater Caucasus region and the Hyrcanian forest, has been proposed as an alternative with high future potential. The translocation of pre-adapted planting material has been proposed as a tool to mitigate negative effects of climate change. This approach can be beneficial but might also harbor risks. Taking advantage of F. orientalis trees planted over 100 years ago in the forest district of Memsen, Germany, we set out to study admixture between the two beech species and the direction of gene flow. Furthermore, we used a range-wide dataset of F. sylvatica and F. orientalis provenances to determine the origin of the introduced trees. Using a combination of nuclear EST-SSRs and one chloroplast SSR marker with species-specific variants, we could show that interspecific gene flow was going in both directions. In most cases, F. sylvatica was the pollen donor which is likely explained by the higher abundance of this species producing vast amounts of pollen. The planted trees originated from the Greater Caucasus region and showed strong genetic divergence from German F. sylvatica populations. In the future, gene flow patterns as well as hybrid performance from different provenances should be tested in additional stands and in comparison to F. sylvatica provenances from southern Europe to assess the suitability of Oriental beech for the mitigation of climate change impacts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","63":"Durante varios siglos Polonia fue un Estado multicultural con los confines orientales \u00e9tnicamente,\r\nculturalmente y ling\u00fc\u00edsticamente diversos.

The isolates were subjected to colonial, morphological and biochemical characterization. Pathogenicity test was carried out on the isolates using blood agar to determine their hemolytic activities. Antibiotic resistance status was also investigated against standard antibiotics using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method and the multiple antibiotic resistance indices of the isolates were also determined. The plasmid profiles were determined and the resistance genes were identified using molecular means. The bacteria species isolated were Veillonella Spp, Vibrio orientalis and Micrococcus luteus. Veillonella Spp showed Beta hemolysis while Micrococcus luteus showed alpha hemolysis and Vibrio orientalis showed gamma hemolysis.

While Classical Arabic (fusha) has been widely recognized by many as the legitimate expression of an Arab-Islamic identity that Egypt partakes of, there have been attempts by Egyptian intellectuals to forge and promote a unique Egyptian identity distinct from the Arab-Islamic geo-political and socio-cultural sphere. Egyptian vernacular Arabic (\u2018ammiyya) has been mainly deployed as the distinctive mark of this identity. While recognizing that the two categories of fusha and \u2018ammiyya and the arbitrary divide between them are epistemological constructs that have been sustained and promoted by a number of institutional and discursive practices, including a linguistic discourse couched in a modernist understanding of reality, this article seeks to pinpoint the social\/cultural economy of these two constructs in the field of drama translation in Egypt.

However, the museum never appointed a specialized curator for its Orient Collection; this is perhaps one of the reasons why an inventory catalog did not appear until 2001. Most of the world-famous pieces originally belonged to the Imperial House of Habsburg and ultimately found their way into the museum after the end of the monarchy. In 1868, the museum itself began collecting in this sector. The carpets from a third source, the \u201cKaiserliches K\u00f6nigliches Handels Museum\u201d Imperial Royal Austrian Trade Museum, were purchased in 1907. This diverse background has had a formative influence on the specific structure of the Vienna collection. Mamluk Carpets are among the highlights of the Viennese collection, especially celebrated for the sole silk Mamluk Carpet existing in the world today. Equally famous and precious are the 16th-century silk Hunting Carpet, a Herat Scrolling Vine and Animal Carpet, a so-called Portuguese Carpet, several Isfahan carpets, carpets from the Ottoman court workshop, among them the Vienna niche rug and an Indian landscape carpet, also the renowned Indian Millefleur carpet. The catalogue contains the one hundred-and-fifty pieces from the Vienna collection starting with five Mamluk Carpets, followed by five Ottoman pieces (Turkey, Istanbul), one small so-called chessboard carpet, nineteen Anatolian carpets and fifteen Iranian carpets from different regions. There are four Indian rugs and rug fragments and seventeen rugs from Central Asia, also one Moroccan piece. The catalogue meticulously characterizes every carpet and locates and dates every piece.

This paper offers a case-study of one moment in the modern genesis of the term and of its translation into a colonial language. Though largely forgotten today by the social sciences, Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931) was one of the most important and popular social thinkers of the Third Republic in France. He was a seminal theoretician of race and a tireless anti-revolutionary polemicist who elaborated a form of historical social Darwinism in which progress was defined in and through increasing social and civilizational inequality. Le Bon greatly influenced the new social thought of the Nahdah period in Egypt \u2013 especially in its liberal and secular currents \u2013 through the many translations that were made of his works between 1909 and 1922. His main translator was Ahmad Fathi Zaghlul: founding member of The Ummah Party, jurist implicated in the infamous Dinshaway affair and an important intellectual of the period in his own right. Zaghlul exemplifies the section of liberal and colonial elites who sought to reform and modernize Egypt according to the \u2018natural\u2019 laws that govern human societies in order to lead the country to independence. This paper examines Zaghlul\u2019s Arabic translation of one of Le Bon\u2019s most important works, Les Lois psychologiques de l\u2019\u00e9volution des peuples (The Psychological Laws of the Evolution of Peoples, 1894\/1913), in order to explore the ambiguous role played by new concepts of \u2018race\u2019, \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018civilization\u2019 in the secular, reformist social thought of the Nahdah in Egypt.","96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":"Durante su \u00faltimo per\\'\u0131odo creativo, Goethe se interes\u00f3 vivamente por las culturas orientales.

The work was undertaken to understand the evolution of Indian literature in general and Indian English fiction in particular over the years. The exploration of the four major works by celebrated novelists has enlightened me on many aspects of India, Indian people and Indian literature. The study has provided me a fascinating and rewarding experience. The novels that are taken up for the study are Salman Rushdie\u2019 s Midnight s Children, Arundhati Roy The God of Small Things, Kiran Desai, The Inheritance of Loss and Arvind Adigas, The White Tiger etc. The critical study of these four novels in connection with each other yields more powerful insight into the understanding of the postcolonial scenario of Indian society. Hence, this study seeks to examine the postcolonial perspective dripped through the four select novels. The thesis contains a detailed study of Indian English fiction as a genre, postcolonial theory, earlier as well as current history of the Booker prize, the depiction of life and literary career of the select novelists through their biographies and exploration of postcolonial aspects in the select novels. newline The four novels under study represent a mirror of Indian Society. The novelists deal with various themes. They depict Indian society and dilemmas of developing national identity after colonial rule. The issues such as caste and class, multiculturalism, feminism, violence, cultural dislocation and crisis of identity are dominant in their writing. The novelists explore postcolonial chaos and despair, misuse of power and exploitation, centre and marginality, voices of subaltern, history, immigration, oppression and political unrest through their writing in an effective manner. The appealing subjects of these novelists are margin between cultures, tradition and modernity, religion and politics, globalization, hybridity and otherness, orientalism, diaspora, etc. Dr. Janmejay Kumar Tiwari \"Postcolonial Perspectives in the Booker Winning Indian Novels\" Published in International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (ijtsrd), ISSN: 2456-6470, Volume-6 | Issue-5 , August 2022, URL: https:\/\/www.ijtsrd.com\/papers\/ijtsrd50618.pdf Paper URL: https:\/\/www.ijtsrd.com\/humanities-and-the-arts\/english\/50618\/postcolonial-perspectives-in-the-booker-winning-indian-novels\/dr-janmejay-kumar-tiwari","110":null,"111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":null,"120":null,"121":null,"122":null,"123":null,"124":null,"125":null,"126":null,"127":null,"128":null,"129":null,"130":null,"131":null,"132":null,"133":null,"134":null,"135":null,"136":null,"137":null,"138":null,"139":null,"140":null,"141":null,"142":null,"143":null,"144":null,"145":null,"146":null,"147":null,"148":null,"149":null,"150":null,"151":null,"152":"The most original works of the theologian of the Empire of Nicaea Nicephoros Blemmydes, are the two treatises (1255-1256) where he defends the expression of several Greek Fathers that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son (per filium).

This is especially true of Catecheses 14-18, which have often been placed during Holy Week. Janeras returns here to this subject, on which he has already written, in order to establish once again that Cat. 18 should be placed on the Friday before Palm Sunday, the last day of Lent in the strict sense before the beginning of the Holy Week fast. The witness of Egeria and of various hagiopolite documents supports this conclusion. And since Cat. 14 was delivered on a Monday, Cat. 14-18 should be distributed Monday to Friday of the week preceeding Holy Week. On that basis one can also establish the year the catecheses were delivered. For in Cat. 14, Cyril refers to the month of Xanthik\u00f3s, hence of spring that has just begun. If Cat. 14-18 were delivered the week before Palm Sunday, then among the possible years for this recurrence, AD 348-351, only the year 350 meets these conditions.","165":null,"166":null,"167":null,"168":null,"169":"AbstractAlthough Edward Said, generally known as one of the founders of postcolonial studies, has written extensively on music, he almost completely ignores popular music. However, the few moments in which he does reflect on popular music are highly revealing. In this article I provide a comprehensive overview and a critical analysis of Said's public statements on popular music, and argue that these strongly create dissonance with his interventions in postcolonial theory and politics. More specifically, I argue that in these reflections on popular music Said voices problematic elitist, orientalist, and universalist claims. Consequently, Said's notion of popular music constitutes perhaps the most antagonistic aspect of his oeuvre.","170":null,"171":null,"172":null,"173":null,"174":null,"175":null,"176":null,"177":null,"178":null,"179":null,"180":null,"181":null,"182":null,"183":null,"184":null,"185":null,"186":null,"187":null,"188":null,"189":"Basil\u2019s appeal to a mysterious Syrian source in Hexaemeron 2.6 has rightfully attracted\r\nthe attention of many earlier scholars.

Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights and its reception in Victorian England is to examine one of the most prominent and widely debated theories of translation in recent years \u2013 Lawrence Venuti's advocacy of 'foreignizing' or 'estranging' translation. According to Venuti, this proposed practice, which does not try to minimize the difference of the foreign text, advances tolerance of the Other and attests to the courage to accept beliefs and cultural values different from one's own as they are, without 'domestication' or naturalization. This paper, however, argues that while Burton's translation was an example of all that Venuti recommends, it was not subversive, nor did it challenge ethnocentric or racist ideas. Indeed, its 'estrangement' of the Arabic text and culture only confirmed the stereotypes and Orientalist images that its readers had of the source culture, thereby acquiescing (often consciously) in the discourse of colonialism. It is suggested that the weakness of Venuti's and similar theoretical postulates lies in their neglect of the context of translation, and their confusion of the strategy of translation with its socio-political and cultural effect","262":null,"263":"El presente constituye el segundo de tres art\\'\u0131culos en los que se analiza el Tratado de Amistad y Comercio entre Espa\u00f1a y Marruecos de 1767 desde la traductolog\\'\u0131a y la historia de la traducci\u00f3n.

Recent progress in molecular typing methods enables large-scale investigations in the population structure of this species. It is now possible to test hypotheses about its evolution which were proposed decades ago. For instance the three classical biovars of different geographical distributions were suggested to originate from Central Asia. Most investigations so far have focused on the typical pestis subspecies representatives found outside of China, whereas the understanding of the emergence of this human pathogen requires the investigation of strains belonging to subspecies pestis from China and to the Microtus biovar.\n\n\n\nMulti-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) with 25 loci was performed on a collection of Y. pestis isolates originating from the majority of the known foci worldwide and including typical rhamnose-negative subspecies pestis as well as rhamnose-positive subspecies pestis and biovar Microtus. More than 500 isolates from China, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Mongolia and a number of other foci around the world were characterized and resolved into 350 different genotypes. The data revealed very close relationships existing between some isolates from widely separated foci as well as very high diversity which can conversely be observed between nearby foci.\n\n\n\nThe results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the Y. pestis subsp. pestis pathogenic for humans emerged in the Central Asia region between China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, only three clones of which spread out of Central Asia. The relationships among the strains in China, Central Asia and the rest of the world based on the MLVA25 assay provide an unprecedented view on the expansion and microevolution of Y. pestis.","292":"This paper investigates changing attitudes toward the \u201cother\u201d in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem from two main perspectives; namely, the crusaders' approach to the former inhabitants of the Holy Land and the degree to which those former Occidentals became Orientals and created a new identity. Taking into account the first encounter with Islam, this paper investigates the emotional aspects of the meeting between Latins and Muslims from the perspective of those Christians who came to the Holy Land, whether as crusaders, settlers of a more permanent nature, or pilgrims. Historical contextualization allows a more suitable analytical and theoretical perspective of the intricate emotional spectrum that was inherent in the history of the Crusader Kingdom. The Latins use of the Augustinian emotional index transformed negative attitudes toward the Muslims into an act of illusionary inclusion in order to exclude. This inverted inclusion meant that within its inner discourse, Christian society had defeated the Muslims symbolically, regardless of the outcome on the battlefield\u2014a denial of reality that served to exclude the Easterners altogether. The inverted inclusion of the Muslims became the last step on the long march of both acknowledging and, at the same time, erasing the infidel, for it was Christianity that defined the cultural boundaries of the West.","293":null,"294":null,"295":null,"296":"Pollen is one of the primary causes of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in urban centers. In the present study, the concentrations of 39 different pollens in the Santiago de Chile metropolitan area over the period 2009-2013 are characterized. The pollen was monitored daily using Burkard volumetric equipment. The contribution of each type of pollen and the corresponding time trends are evaluated. The concentrations of the pollens are compared with the established threshold levels for the protection of human health. The results show that the total amount of pollen grains originating from trees, grasses, weeds and indeterminate sources throughout the period of the study was 258,496 grains m-3, with an annual average of 51,699 +\/- 3,906 grains m-3 year-1. The primary source of pollen is Platanus orientalis, which produces 61.8% of the analyzed pollen. Grass pollen is the third primary component of the analyzed pollen, with a contribution of 5.82%. Among the weeds, the presence of Urticacea (3.74%) is remarkable. The pollination pattern of the trees is monophasic, and the grasses have a biphasic pattern. The trends indicate that the total pollen and tree pollen do not present a time trend that is statistically significant throughout the period of the study, whereas the grass pollen and weed pollen concentrations in the environment present a statistically significant decreasing trend. The cause of this decrease is unclear. The pollen load has doubled over the past decade. When the observed concentrations of the pollens were compared with the corresponding threshold levels, the results indicated that over the period of the study, the pollen concentrations were at moderate, high and very high levels for an average of 293 days per year. Systematic counts of the pollen grains are an essential method for diagnosing and treating patients with pollinosis and for developing forestation and urban planning strategies.","297":"<p>Muchas de las tecnolog\u00edas introducidas por los \u00e1rabes en al-Andalus tienen origen romano o principalmente oriental, siendo estas utilizadas para mejorar el manejo y aplicaci\u00f3n del riego, y para llevar el agua a las ciudades.

Muslim inhabitants of the town of Patane on the Malayan peninsula warily confront a Dutch landing party whose bearing suggests that it is engaged in yet another episode in the saga of European overseas exploration and discovery. The presence of the Muslims in Malaya reflects an earlier process of expansion that saw Islamic civilization spread from Spain and Morocco in the west to the Philippines in the east in the millennium between the 7th and 17th centuries. The Dutch came by sea to an area on the coastal and island fringes of Asia, the one zone where their warships gave them a decisive edge in this era.

It is addressed in particular to students of anthropology, but is also intended as a one-volume guide to those, such as social historians and geographers, who find it necessary to understand patterns of kinship in different places and at different times. The book is divided into two parts. It opens with a discussion of what kinship means to the social anthropologist as distinct from the biologist, and considers the different possible approaches to the subject within social anthropology itself. The following chapters cover topics such as descent, inheritance, succession, the family, residence, marriage, kinship terminology, systems and pseudo-systems of affinal alliance, the new reproductive technologies, and symbolic approaches to kinship. In Part II four chapters provide an overview of theoretical debates concerning aspects of kinship, and consider, for example, how recent work on gender, person, and the body have challenged and modified earlier assumptions about, for example, descent, succession, and familial alliances. The book applies and illustrates these concepts and topics to a number of contrasting case studies. These illustrate the insights that can be achieved from the study of kinship, and also show that the complexity of even the most familiar kinship patterns rarely lends itself to simple description. The author also includes annotated guides to further reading.","378":"This is the first textbook on social network analysis integrating theory, applications, and professional software for performing network analysis (Pajek).

Interpretive anthropology by Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, and others, historical work influenced by the Annales school, studies of mass media, and the work of structuralists and post-structuralists from many disciplines are all discussed.

Articles in journals were the predominant outlet in all disciplines. Monographs and popularizing articles were more important outlets in lsquosofterrsquo fields than in lsquoharderrsquo ones. The enlightenment function of scholarship was especially evident in Dutch literature and language, and public administration. Only some of the humanities disciplines are locally oriented. Although many publications were written in English, only experimental psychology, general linguistics, anthropology, and genrral literature were internationally oriented regarding output media. The impact of departments differed greatly both within and between disciplines. For all disciplines, bibliometric indicators are potentially useful for monitoring international impact, as expert interviews confirmed. Especially in Dutch language, Dutch literature and public administration, ISI-citation data are not very useful for monitoring national impact.","383":"This book provides an exciting and diverse philosophical exploration of the role of practice and practices in human activity.

However, there is little systematic analysis in the literature that explains the way social capital aids in fostering collective action. The paper integrates ideas from institutional ecological economics, sociology and anthropology to argue that power relations, involving struggle and resistance, should be acknowledged as they affect collective action. We address the question of why social capital should not be straightforwardly associated positively with common property resource management. To unravel the complexity of the links between social capital, collective action and common property resource management, the concepts of common knowledge and symbolic power are introduced.","385":"Food production and translation have in common a long relationship with different forms of technology. As societies and economies in many parts of the world are faced with dramatic changes as a result of advances in computing power and software development, changes that are directly affecting translation itself, it is argued that responses to the technologisation of food production are instructive for the future direction of translation both as a profession and as a domain of research. More specifically, analysing dimensions to the practice of food translation points up the emergence of a political ecology of translation. These dimensions include translational productivity, the role of the local or place and the fractal properties of language in translation. This emergent ecology draws on key concepts from social anthropology such as ?wayfaring? and ?meshwork? to reconceptualise the potential agency of the translator in what is increasingly referred to as the Second Machine Age. A crucial component of this new ecology of translation is an attention to inter-species communication and how the translation paradigm is an inescapable part of human?animal relationships.","386":"Although there has been much discussion in recent years of the applicability of mathematical methods in the social sciences, little attention has been paid to the interaction of the sociological analysis and the mathematics. In this paper, an example of an extremely fruitful interaction between anthropology and mathematics is described. The interaction has, on the one hand, greatly increased the subtlety and sophistication of the sociological analysis, white on the other eland it has posed interesting mathematical questions.","387":"The use of bibliometric data is a means of comparing research productivity and scholarly impact for individuals, work groups, institutions and nations within and between disciplines. Central to this debate is the notion that disciplines differ in the ways in which they exchange ideas and disseminate information and therefore have diverse publishing and citation patterns. In this article we use two different approaches to compiling bibliometric data to compare publishing patterns of five different disciplines that encompass Molecular Biology, Administration\/Political Science, Psychology, Philosophy and Sociology\/Anthropology. We find that the social sciences differ from each other as well as from the physical sciences in their publication and citation patterns. Further, while the different ways of organizing the data produce somewhat different results, the substantive findings for the general patterning of publications and citations of disciplines are consistent for both data sets. Sociology\/Anthropology, when compared with the other disciplines, shows substantial differences across universities.","388":"Sound has come to have a particular resonance in many disciplines over the past decade.

While Christian sacred topography is usually interpreted in narrowly religious terms as points of contact with holy places and people, this book considers church buildings as spatial environments in which a range of social \u2018work\u2019 happened. It draws on approaches developed in the fields of anthropology, ritual studies, and social geography to examine, for example, how church buildings facilitated commemoration of the community's dead, establishment of a shared historical past, and communication with the divine. Surveying evidence for the introduction of saints into liturgical performance and the architectural and decorative programs of churches, this analysis explains how saints helped to bolster the boundaries of church space, reinforce local social and religious hierarchies, and negotiate the community's place within larger regional and cosmic networks.","396":"The anthropological record clearly shows that there remains a strong political undercurrent in terms of Theravada Buddhism, spiritualism, animism, supernaturalism, and scams in Thailand. The literature review of this new anthropology provides the main academic works that have been published vis-\u00c3 \u02d8a-vis the Theravada Buddhism, animism, and supernaturalism. Scams have been added to this academic paper as they are based on the former, and scams in late modernity have emerged and evolved from the new anthropology. It is a new anthropology for the following three main reasons: (1) it adopts a modern approach to understanding such cultural, social, and traditional phenomena; (2) the method involves both normative and quantitative methods used in the social and political sciences; and (3) a more objective and scientific approach is adopted in the new political tropology because of the uneven distribution of power in these cultural and social phenomena. Individuals actually have a choice to avoid being scammed. Yet, millions of people seem to prefer to be duped. People keep losing billions of dollars to scammers. Why is this so? This study seeks to explain this social phenomenon. Think of the word \u201cscam\u201d and what comes to mind is a wide range of scams targeting old people\u2019s life savings; insecure women in Singapore seeking romance and erotic love from Turkish men; poor Turkish men in Singapore living off their Singaporean girlfriends and wives (they usually have one of each simultaneously); financial scams by lawyers and foreigners in Thailand; phishing scams in Malaysia; as well as gambling scams and online scams in Singapore. Millions continue to be lost in scams involving fake government agencies, including Singapore\u2019s Income Tax Agency and Singapore\u2019s CPF Board. While legitimate governments spend billions of dollars on countermeasures to combat these nefarious tricksters, there appears to be little to nothing that is achieved. People are very easily misled. This study focused on multimillion-dollar scammers who prey on individuals who believe in magic, ritual, occult, tradition, religion, and superstition. Ignoramuses, the mentally retarded, and simpletons are often superstitious; they are the most likely to fall for scams. Scams take place in crowded places with a high walk-in, street-level crowd, and the profits range from a few cents to thousands of dollars a second. This study concludes with a clear solution to the problems associated with superstition and scams in Southeast Asia. There is a politics to Asian scams because of the uneven distribution of power among those who believe in superstitions, animism, and religions; it is a paradox that makes many people vulnerable to being scammed.","397":"Network analysis is an approach to research that is uniquely suited to describing, exploring, and understanding structural and relational aspects of health. It is both a methodological tool and a theoretical paradigm that allows us to pose and answer important ecological questions in public health. In this review we trace the history of network analysis, provide a methodological overview of network techniques, and discuss where and how network analysis has been used in public health. We show how network analysis has its roots in mathematics, statistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, physics, and computer science. In public health, network analysis has been used to study primarily disease transmission, especially for HIV\/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; information transmission, particularly for diffusion of innovations; the role of social support and social capital; the influence of personal and social networks on health behavior; and the interorganizational structure of health systems. We conclude with future directions for network analysis in public health.","398":"Eleven historical-ethnographic case studies examine the social and cultural projects of modern schools, and the contestations, dramatic and not, that emerge in and around and against them.

The studies advance the concept of cultural production as a way of understanding the dynamics of power and identity formation underlying different forms of \"education.\" Using the concept of the \"educated person\" as a culture-specific construct, the authors examine conflicts and points of convergence between cultural practices and knowledges that are produced in and out of schools.","399":"This book explores the interconnected ways in which the control of knowledge has become central to the exercise of political, economic, and social power.

Focussing on Tarde's political writings, this article seeks to counter this prevalent vision of Tarde as a thinker of molecular social processes who provides us with the tools to think beyond the parameters of sovereignty and to embrace a transnational understanding of social change. Tarde's thinking of politics is analysed in terms of its reliance on a political anthropology of obedience, its ambivalent attitude towards the democratization of the political sphere, its image of the state as an enabler and filter of inventions, and its attempts to articulate the relation between the social and the political. By means of the notion of 'empowering pacification', the article concludes that the significance of Tarde for the present lies in his contradictory and symptomatic conceptualization of the persistence of political power and institutional centralization in the midst of a tendency towards the global expansion of the field of social interactions, as well as in his strategic attempt to imagine forms of power that would neutralize the possibility of social turmoil and class conflict.","403":"The classical notion that innovations are most readily adopted by marginal men appears to be contradicted by published findings regarding the adoption of certain new drugs by physicians. It is suggested that innovations of different kinds find readiest adoption among individuals in different positions of the social structure. Notions drawn from the sociology of change, group dynamics, rural sociology, cultural anthropology, and decision analysis form the basis for a more specific set of hypotheses, which invoke \"emancipation-conformity,\" \"communication,\" and \u00e4ssurance\" as mechanisms that intervene between social position and the acceptance of an innovation. Predictions derived from the hypotheses are tested by an examination of several forms of innovation-accepting behavior on the part of the physicians originally described. While the test proves far from adequate, it permits the conclusion that the hypothetical scheme, at least in broad outline, is a fruitful starting point for further research.","404":"In this paper we want to reconsider the role anthropology (both its theory and methods) can play within HCI research. One of the areas anthropologists can contribute to here is to rethink the notion of social context where technology is used. Context is usually equated with the immediate activities such as work tasks, when and by whom the task is performed. This tends to under represent some fundamental aspects of social life, like culture and history. In this paper, we want to open up a discussion about what context means in HCI and to emphasize socio-structural and historical aspects of the term. We will suggest a more inclusive analytic way that able the HCI community to make \"better\" sense of use situation. An example of technology use in a workplace will be given to demonstrate the yields this kind of theoretical framework can bring into HCI.","405":"Abstract This article calls for a re-conceptualization of the social sciences by asking for a cosmopolitan turn. The intellectual undertaking of redefining cosmopolitanism is a trans-disciplinary one, which includes geography, anthropology, ethnology, international relations, international law, political philosophy and political theory, and now sociology and social theory. Methodological nationalism, which subsumes society under the nation-state, has until now made this task almost impossible. The alternative, a 'cosmopolitan outlook', is a contested term and project. Cosmopolitanism must not be equalized with the global (or globalization), with 'world system theory' (Wallerstein), with 'world polity' (Meyer and others), or with 'world-society' (Luhmann). All of those concepts presuppose basic dualisms, such as domestic\/foreign or national\/international, which in reality have become ambiguous. Methodological cosmopolitanism opens up new horizons by demonstrating how we can make the empirical investigation of border crossings and other transnational phenomena possible.","406":"This article calls for a re-conceptualization of the social sciences by asking for a cosmopolitan turn.

Seawater as culture manifests as a medium of pleasure, sustenance, travel, disaster. I argue that, although seawater's qualities in early anthropology were portrayed impressionistically, today technical, scientific descriptions of water's form prevail. For example, processes of globalization\u2014which may also be called \u201coceanization\u201d\u2014are often described as \u201ccurrents,\u201d\u201cflows,\u201d and \u201ccirculations.\u201d Examining sea-set ethnography, maritime anthropologies, and contemporary social theory, I propose that seawater has operated as a \u201ctheory machine\u201d for generating insights about human cultural organization.

In particular, a line of critical thought that traces its origins to a Husserlian critique of rationality remains as relevant and resonant as ever. In order to demonstrate how this is so, a reconceptualisation of the notion of production in social anthropology is linked to the historical practice of translation to argue for the severe limitations of forms of political thought and cultural practice based on a notion of the transitive. This paradigm of transitivity is then related to forms of instrumentality that underlie the extension of neo-liberal economic rationale to all forms of social existence. It is only through the convergence of critical thinking across Europe, both from the present and the recent past, that Europe can be saved from market capture and populist repudiation.","411":"In this innovative approach to the practice of social science, Charles Ragin explores the use of fuzzy sets to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative methods. Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, \"fuzzy\" instrument (the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other) with a precise one (degree of membership in a well-defined set). Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon \"homogenizing assumptions\" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book should revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.","412":"\u00c4frican Urban Spaces in Historical Perspective presents new and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of African urban history and culture. It presents original research and integrates historical methodologies with those of anthropology, geography, literature, art, and architecture.

The themes include Islam and Christianity, architecture, migration, globalization, social and physical decay, identity, race relations, politics, and development. This book elaborates on not only what makes the study of African urban spaces unique within urban historiography, it also offers an encompassing and up-to-date study of the subject and inserts Africa into the growing debate on urban history and culture throughout the world.\"--BOOK JACKET.","413":"Collection development in college and university libraries most often occurs using longstanding traditional selection methods, such as favorable book reviews or local user needs. This study uses citation analysis as a tool to select books for the social science book collection in one academic library and compares the circulation of books using traditional methods to those books using citation analysis. The journal impact factor was used to determine those journals and authors cited the most in the disciplines of business, anthropology, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. If those authors published books, the books were purchased and circulation data on the books were tabulated and compared to books chosen using traditional methods. Findings indicate that books purchased using traditional methods of selection circulated more, except when individual disciplines were measured. In the areas of business, political science, and psychology, there was no significant difference in circulation statistics, and together both the traditional and citation analysis methods accounted for circulation of nearly 95% of the social science collection. Since it is based on scholarly activity, citation analysis is a collection development method that could be used in all academic libraries.","414":"The theory of social representations occupies a place apart in social psychology both by the problems it raises and the scale of the phenomena with which it deals. This provokes many a criticism and misunderstanding. Such a theory may not correspond with the model of social psychology as it is defined at present. One attempts however to show that it answers important social and scientific questions, in what it differs from the classical conception of collective representations and, from the very beginning, adopts a constructivist perspective which has spread in social psychology since. Several trends of research have confirmed its vision of the relations between social and cognitive phenomena, communication and thought. More detailed remarks aim at outlining the nature of social representations, their capacity to create information, their function which is to familiarize us with the strange, according to the categories of our culture. Going farther, one insists on the diversity of methodological approaches. If the experimental method is useful to understand how people should think, higher mental and social processes must be approached by different methods, including linguistic analysis and observation of how people think. No doubt, social representations have a relation with the more recent field of social cognition. But inasmuch as the former depend on content and context, i.e. subjectivity and sociability of people, they approach the phenomena differently from the latter. Referring to child psychology and anthropology, one can contend, despite appearances, that it is also a more scientific approach. There is however much to be learned from criticisms and there is still a long way to go before we arrive at a satisfactory theory of social thinking and communication.","415":"Case Study Research: Principles and Practices aims to provide a general understanding of the case study method as well as specific tools for its successful implementation. These tools can be utilized in all fields where the case study method is prominent, including business, anthropology, communications, economics, education, medicine, political science, social work, and sociology. Topics include the definition of a 'case study,' the strengths and weaknesses of this distinctive method, strategies for choosing cases, an experimental template for understanding research design, and the role of singular observations in case study research. It is argued that a diversity of approaches - experimental, observational, qualitative, quantitative, ethnographic - may be successfully integrated into case study research. This book breaks down traditional boundaries between qualitative and quantitative, experimental and nonexperimental, positivist and interpretivist.","416":"This article examines the institutional discourses and practices that have characterized the process of incorporation of a group of Rom refugees from the former Yugoslavia in Bologna, the 'showcase' of the Italian Left. Following an anthropology of policy approach, the article provides insights into both the conditions of refugees in Italy and the relationships which exist between the political Left and the 'new' immigrations. This is done by showing how the discourses and the practices of the Left can be oppressive and how such oppression is not merely due to an inescapable macro-structural order of things but has local 'origins', too. Thus it is argued that if social justice is still a priority in the political agenda of the mainstream Left in Italy, as is claimed, then the Left has some rethinking to do in order to avoid its entanglement and responsibility in processes of oppression and domination in the context of migration.","417":"Writing,citation, and other canon-setting patterns in the recent (1977-86) litera-\r\nture of sociocultural anthropology reveal the impact of gender relations.

Data about publication patterns in leading journals document this situation as well as a variance in theoretical orientations. IR is conducted differently in different places. The main patterns are explained through a sociology of science model that emphasizes the different nine- teen th-century histories of the state, the early format of social science, and the institutionalized delineation among the different social sciences. The internal social and intellectual structure of American IR is two-tiered, with relatively independent subfields and a top layer defined by access to the leading journals (on which IR, in contrast to some social sciences, has a high consensus). The famous successive 'great debates' serve an important function by letting lead theorists focus and structure the whole discipline. IR in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom has historically been structured differently, often with power vested more locally. American IR now moves in a direction that undermines its global hegemony. The widespread turn to rational choice privileges a reintegration (and status-wise rehabilitation) with the rest of political science over attention to JR practices elsewhere. This rationalistic turn is alien to Europeans, both because their IR is generally closer to sociology, philosophy, and anthropology, and because the liberal ontological premises of rational choice are less fitting to European societies. Simultaneously, European IR is beginning to break the local power bastions and establish independent research communities at a national or, increasingly, a European level. As American IR turns from global hegemony to national professionalization, IR becomes more pluralistic.","419":"This work presents both a history and an overview of current production in the Argentine sociology of culture. Based on the so-called double periphery \u2013 the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology \u2013 the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina's last dictatorship (1976\u20131983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field's sociological aspects as it moves along this path.","420":"Paul DiMaggio's (1997) Annual Review of Sociology article urged integration of the cognitive and the cultural, triggering a cognitive turn in cultural sociology.

This article reviews work published since DiMaggio's agenda-setting piece\u2014research that builds on cross-disciplinary links between cultural sociology and the cognitive sciences. These works present new ideas on the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of culture, on how forms of personal culture interact, on how culture becomes shared, and on how social interaction and cultural environments inform cognitive processes. Within our discussion, we point to research questions that remain unsettled. We then conclude with issues for future research in culture and cognition that can enrich sociological analysis about action more generally.","421":"Recent findings in neuroscience have shown differential patterns in brain activity in response to similar\r\nstimuli and activities across cultural and social differences. This calls for a framework to understand how\r\nsuch differences may come to be implemented in brains and neurons. Based on strands of research in\r\nsocial anthropology, we argue that human practices are characterized by particular patterns, and that\r\nparticipating in these patterns orders how people perceive and act in particular group- and contextspecific\r\nways. This then leads to a particular patterning of neuronal processes that may be detected using\r\ne.g. brain imaging methods. We illustrate this through (a) a classical example of phoneme perception\r\n(b) recent work on performance in experimental game play. We then discuss these findings in the\r\nlight of predictive models of brain function. We argue that a \u2018culture as patterned practices\u2019 approach\r\nobviates a rigid nature-culture distinction, avoids the problems involved in conceptualizing \u2018culture\u2019 as a\r\nhomogenous grouping variable, and suggests that participating as a competent participant in particular\r\npractices may affect both the subjective (first person) experience and (third person) objective measures\r\nof behavior and brain activity.","422":"Weakly theorized, lacking even an agreed definition, ethnicity has joined the list of deconstructed concepts in anthropology. This article argues that an escape from the nihilistic excesses of deconstructionism is possible if ethnicity is `re-located' from the narrow space it inhabits in current theories (social, cultural or psychological) to the active interface between the mind, society and culture. Two bodies of case material (from urban Papua New Guinea and New Zealand) are presented here in an attempt to demonstrate that, firstly, ethnicity is the product of an empirically available activity, classifying people according to their origins, and secondly a great deal of cultural and symbolic content accretes to these classifications. When ethnicity becomes subject to the elaborations of cultural or identity politics it often develops into a focus of symbolic contestation. The symbolic and ideological elaborations of ethnicity present analysts with phenomena analytically separate from ethnic classification itself","423":"My starting point in this article is the community interpreter who works in social, medical and legal settings, under specific conditions, confronting very delicate ethical problems.

One important payoff of this exercise is that the common misinterpretation of the Habitus as an objectivist and reductionist element in Bourdieu's thought is dispelled. The Habitus is shown to be instead a useful and flexible way to concep-tualize agency and the ability to transform social structure.

This article extends the existing literature by providing a finer grained understanding of key influences in tourism research. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of the tourism literature by examining papers authored by Australian and New Zealand researchers in Annals of Tourism Research and Tourism Management between 1994 and 2007. A general picture of the field is drawn by examining keywords, the most-cited authors and works, as well as co-citation patterns. The analysis is extended by the use of social network analysis to explore the links between keywords and influential works in the field. The article also addresses the conference theme by identifying emerging themes and influences. Results indicate that tourism research in Australia and New Zealand has been strongly influenced by sociology and anthropology, geography and behavioural psychology. Emerging themes have focused on the health and safety of tourists, risk, wine tourism and segmentation.","428":"At a time when the supply of resources is a problem, William Leiss analyses demand and consumption. Why do we need so much? Does the ability to choose from such a wide range of commodities give us more satisfaction? Why do we accept being pushed into buying products about which we know little because they promise to give us a particular characteristic - freshness, happiness, sex appeal?\tConsumerism and capitalist and socialist industry have reached the point where state power is legitimatized by its ability to increase the number of commodities. A unique culture has been created in which marketing is the main social bond. Values no longer shape and condition needs, wants, desires, or preferences. Leiss draws on economics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology to show the vagueness of our thought on the relation between nature and culture, desire and reason, needs and commodities. This book raises serious, vital questions for all those concerned about the future of our present society.","429":"Modern linguistics has been widely adopted by anthropologists who operate on the basis of deep knowledge and deep thinking in various fields, from historical and descriptive studies to semantics and a variety of social orientations.

Drawing from studies of science and education, this chapter argues that epistemic practices are interactional (constructed among people through concerted activity), contextual (situated in social practices and cultural norms), intertextual (communicated through a history of coherent discourses, signs, and symbols), and consequential (legitimized knowledge instantiates power and culture). Through a review of science studies, the argument for the relevance of a focus on epistemic practices is developed. This chapter draws from the empirical studies of scientific practice to derive implications for science teaching and learning. There has been considerable empirical work from multiple disciplinary perspectives (cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, and rhetoric) informing perspectives about science and the inner workings of scientific communities. These studies examine the practices, discourses, and cultures of scientists and scientific communities. These perspectives are applied to three types of educational approaches for science learning (through inquiry, engineering, and socioscientific issues) to examine ways that engaging in epistemic practices supports goals of scientific literacy. The chapter shows how a focus on the knowledge construction processes in schools offers contributions to thinking about science education.","431":"Human\u2013robot interaction HRI is essentially the field of study of interactions between humans and robots.

Is there a space for anthropologists in public debates about our era's acute economic dilemmas? The short answer should be yes, partly because anthropologists are trained to probe social silences and make the invisible visible, and because we reject the pitfalls of Econ 101, oversimplifications that pervade public discourse. Academic anthropologists can draw lessons from what we might term \u2018public economics\u2019, as well as from the writings of Gillian Tett, an award-winning financial columnist trained in anthropology. Perhaps we can also learn a little from tricksters \u2013 or from satirical activists who deploy irony, caricature, and paradox as sharp instruments in this age of austerity and billionaires. As we analyze finance and the economy in the aftermath of a financial meltdown whose causes and policy implications are intensely debated, our challenge still is to satisfy journalists' appetite for sound-bite narratives without sacrificing nuance, historical contingency, and complexity.","433":"This pioneering book teaches readers to use R within four core analytical areas applicable to the Humanities: networks, text, geospatial data, and images. This book is also designed to be a bridge: between quantitative and qualitative methods, individual and collaborative work, and the humanities and social scientists.

Early chapters take readers from R set-up to exploratory data analysis (continuous and categorical data, multivariate analysis, and advanced graphics with emphasis on aesthetics and facility). Everything is hands-on: networks are explained using U.S. Supreme Court opinions, and low-level NLP methods are applied to short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The book's data, code, appendix with 100 basic programming exercises and solutions, and dedicated website are valuable resources for readers. The methodology will have wide application in classrooms and self-study for the humanities, but also for use in linguistics, anthropology, and political science. Outside the classroom, this intersection of humanities and computing is particularly relevant for research and new modes of dissemination across archives, museums and libraries.","434":"This paper formalizes a widely discussed peer effect titled \u00e4cting\r\n    White.\" \u00c4cting White\" is modeled as a two-audience signaling quandary:\r\n    signals that induce high wages can be signals that induce peer group\r\n    rejection.

Balkin offers a strikingly original theory of cultural evolution, a theory that explains shared understandings, disagreement, and diversity within cultures.  Drawing on many fields of study - including anthropology, evolutionary theory, cognitive science, linguistics, sociology, political theory, philosophy, social psychology, and law - the author explores how cultures grow and spread, how shared understandings arise, and how people of different cultures can understand and evaluate each other's views.  Cultural evolution occurs through the transmission of cultural information and know-how-\"cultural software\"-in human minds, Balkin says.  Individuals embody cultural software and spread it to others through communication and social learning.  Ideology, the author contends, is neither a special nor a pathological form of thought but an ordinary product of the evolution of cultural software.  Because cultural understanding is a patchwork of older imperfect tools that are continually adapted to solve new problems, human understanding is partly adequate and party inadequate to the pursuit of justice.  Balkin presents numerous examples that illuminate the sources of ideological effects and their contributions to injustice.  He also enters the current debate over multiculturalism, applying his theory to problems of mutual understanding between people who hold different worldviews.  He argues that cultural understanding presupposes transcendent ideals and shows how both ideological analysis of others and ideological self-criticism are possible.","437":"This will be the standard study on the \"body\" in relation to the major\n\treligions.

The primary questions these regulations are meant to resolve include the following: (1) What is yoga? (2) What is its proprietary nature? and (3) Who has the right to manage its expression? Two recent U.S. federal district court cases involving the Bikram Yoga College of India, a yoga franchise based in Los Angeles, have drawn international attention to the debate on whether yogic knowledge or practice resides in the public or private domain. This article asks, if given the monetary value at stake, did the global market for transnational commercial yoga set the stage for claims to individual IPRs? Furthermore, this article analyzes how yoga, due to its unique characteristics as an embodied practice and intangible form, serves as a platform for experimentation from which new meanings of open source, IPRs, and information management strategies emerge.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I would like to thank the Department of Anthropology, the School of Social Sciences, and the Center for Asian Studies at the University of California, Irvine, for their funding support.","439":"This paper starts by examining recent work by applied linguists who argue that creativity is not only a property of especially skilled and gifted language users, but is pervasive in routine everyday practice. Also variously addressing literariness, language play and humour, this apparent democratization of creativity contributes to a more general refocusing within applied linguistics on language users as creative designers of meaning. Alongside the textual analysis of poetic form, there has been an increasing interest in the interactional functions of creativity, suggesting the need for a more dynamic model which can address the dialogical nature of everyday creativity, its sociohistorical dimensions and processes of contextualization. In order to suggest how such a model could be developed, the authors draw on Russian sociohistorical conceptions of the evaluative function of language as social sign and bring together the applied linguistic research with work from linguistic anthropology on contextualization, framing, and reflexivity within performance. While linguistic anthropologists have focused mainly on traditional oral art, the authors argue that the framing and critical potential of performance is also keyed by more fleeting uses of poetic language in everyday interaction. In relation to four contrasting examples of data, they suggest how an integrated analytical framework might be developed which addresses textual, contextual, and critical dimensions of creativity.","440":"This work is a bold new effort to embrace all aspects of life--molecular, cellular, behavioral, and cultural--with formulation of a general theory of evolution that extends classical Darwinian theory to include human society.\n\n'Evolutionary Systems and Society 'describes Csanyi's replicative theory of biological and cultural evolution, which represents a major theoretical synthesis of the life sciences and the social sciences. The work spans a vast intellectual and scientific territory, from systems sciences through genetics, cell biology, ethnology, and evolutionary biology to cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and culture. Csanyi demonstrates that the interactions of components in the biological realm (molecules, cells, organisms, ecosystems) and in societies (people, artifacts, ideas) all have a replicative organization. This replicative organization (a mechanism for information storage and reproduction) exists in human societies in a form analogous to biological systems.\n\nJust as the general theory of evolution helps explains the spontaneous emergence of replicative functions and organizations in biological systems, it can be employed to evaluate new departures in social systems. Csanyi uses this concept to explore the origins and evolution of human society and to explain the replicative paradigm to processes of the animal and human mind and to culture. He points out that human culture has all the criteria of a biological system. Its basic components--people, ideas, and man-made artifacts--functionally form a complex replicative network that behaves as systematic unit that evolves at an ever-increasing rate.\n\nIn summarizing the implications of his theory, Csanyimaintains that coordinated replication governed by a regulatory system is necessary if we are to contain the possibility of life-ending nuclear war and insure human survival.","441":"Aujourd\u2019hui, le d\u00e9veloppement local fait face \u00e0 des exigences toujours plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es, ce qui a suscit\u00e9 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sans cesse grandissant du \u00ab d\u00e9veloppement local \u00bb et ce face aux bilans critiques des politiques de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomiques et sociales \u00e0 la fois dans les pays post modernes et les pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement ou \u00e9mergents.

As such, he has examined the epistemology of social sciences in an interdisciplinary perspective. In this interview, he calls on different schools of psychology and, in particular, on psychoanalysis to discuss the epistemological basis of research in translation studies. In his view, philosophy, psychoanalysis and translation studies are three reflexive disciplines, that is, they reflect on what one experiences, thinks or does. He speaks in favour of what he calls \u00fcne traductologie productive,\" whose interest lies not in analyzing existing translations but rather the process of translation, and this is why he makes reference to psychology. Translation studies would be situated at the junction of linguistics and comparative literature, with philosophy towering above and psychology as its base. All social sciences and cultural studies are ultimately related to this field of research. For Jean-Ren\u00e9 Ladmiral it tends to take on the scope of an interdisciplinary anthropology of translation.","443":"Evolutionary anthropology has focused on the origins of war, or rather ethnocentricity, because it epitomizes the problem of group selection, and because war may itself have been the main agent of group selection. The neo-Darwinian synthesis in biology has explained how ethnocentricity might evolve by group selection, and the distinction between evoked culture and adopted culture, suggested by the emerging synthesis in evolutionary psychology, has explained how it might be transmitted. Ethnocentric mechanisms could have evolved by genetic selection in ancestral hominids, or through the interaction of genetic and cultural selection in modern humans, or both. The existence of similar behaviors in chimpanzees and the parallel development of early human societies around the globe are arguments for such inherited mechanisms. There may have been some adaptive breakthroughs in purely cultural evolution, but this process does not seem likely to produce long-term Darwinian adaptations because of the prolificity of cultural traits. Warfare may once have been a major agent of group selection, but the rates of extinction among human groups are so slow as to render this improbable since the rise of state-level societies, whose warfare tends to become a cyclical balance-of-power situation. Perhaps the most serious implication of current evolutionary thought is that the individualistic model of culture common in the social sciences and humanities is outmoded, and should be replaced by a new model that recognizes the organismic nature of human societies.","444":"Accomplished authors, Preece, Rogers and Sharp, have written a key new textbook on this core subject area.

New methodological and theoretical approaches have shed light on the meanings and practices that, for good and for bad, turn the state into the great enframer of our lives. States of Imagination draws together the best of this recent critical thinking to explore the postcolonial state. Contributors focus on a variety of locations from Guatemala, Pakistan, and Peru to India and Ecuador and present unique vantage points, including that of rural schools, police departments, small villages, and the inside of the truth commission.Focusing on the micro-politics of everyday state-making, the contributors examine the mythologies, paradoxes, and inconsistencies of the state through ethnographies of diverse postcolonial practices. They show how the authority of the state is constantly challenged from the local as well as the global, and how growing demands to confer rights and recognition to ever more citizens, organisations, and institutions reveal the persistence of the myth of the state as a source of social order and an embodiment of popular sovereignty. Demonstrating the indispensable value of ethnographic work on the practices and the symbols of the state, States of Imagination showcases a range of studies and methods to provide insight into the diverse forms of the postcolonial state as an arena of both political and cultural struggle.This collection will interest students and scholars of anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, political science, and history.","446":"In this article, we describe the eccentric location of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy: while it remains marginal in terms of institutional recognition, it is nevertheless important in terms of the interest it arouses in professors and students alike, and in the amount and quality of publications in the area. The field's general flexibility appeals both to many established researchers, who employ its methodologies to expand the scope of their investigations, and to many students, who become frustrated with disciplinary rigidity and with the difficulty in carrying out academic projects with overtly political underpinnings from the traditional disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. While student demand is clearly strong in much of Latin America, the response to the rise of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy has taken two general forms: (1) an opening up of spaces within existing disciplines (anthropology, communications, literature, etc.) for the more interdisciplinary or politicized work and (2) the foundation of new programmes in Cultural Studies. We use as examples the case studies of Argentina and Colombia, countries that have a completely different academic history and tradition. We survey the diverse ways in which Cultural Studies has entered institutional spaces in both countries. Colombia offers the case of an academy that appears to have welcomed the institutionalization of Cultural Studies, at least superficially, while Argentina appears to have resisted ceding the field institutional space. Nonetheless, its presence in both countries is strongly palpable; it is clearly a force too strong to be suppressed by resistance from the traditional disciplines.","447":"From Tokyo to Helsinki, Manhattan to Manila, Howard Rheingold takes us on a journey around the world for a preview of the next techno-cultural shift-a shift he predicts will be as dramatic as the widespread adoption of the PC in the 1980s and the Internet in the 1990s. The coming wave, says Rheingold, is the result of super-efficient mobile communications-cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and wireless-paging and Internet-access devices that will allow us to connect with anyone, anywhere, anytime.From the amusing (\"Lovegetty\" devices in Japan that light up when a person with the right date-potential characteristics appears in the vicinity) to the extraordinary (the overthrow of a repressive regime in the Philippines by political activists who mobilized by forwarding text messages via cell phones), Rheingold gives examples of the fundamentally new ways in which people are already engaging in group or collective action. He also considers the dark side of this phenomenon, such as the coordination of terrorist cells, threats to privacy, and the ability to incite violent behavior.Applying insights from sociology, artificial intelligence, engineering, and anthropology, Rheingold offers a penetrating perspective on the brave new convergence of pop culture, cutting-edge technology, and social activism. At the same time, he reminds us that, as with other technological revolutions, the real impact of mobile communications will come not from the technology itself but from how people use it, resist it, adapt to it, and ultimately use it to transform themselves, their communities, and their institutions.","448":null,"449":"Human-Centered Software Engineering: Bridging HCI, Usability and Software Engineering  From its beginning in the 1980's, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has been defined as a multidisciplinary arena. By this I mean that there has been an explicit recognition that distinct skills and perspectives are required to make the whole effort of designing usable computer systems work well. Thus people with backgrounds in Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) joined with people with backgrounds in various behavioral science disciplines (e. g., cognitive and social psychology, anthropology) in an effort where all perspectives were see nas essential to creating usable systems. But while the field of HCI brings individuals with many background disciplines together to discuss a common goal -- the development of useful, usable, satisfying systems -- the form of the collaboration remains unclear. Are we striving to coordinate the varied activities in system development, or are we seeking a richer collaborative framework? In coordination, Usability and SE skills can remain quite distinct and while the activities of each group might be critical to the success of a project, we need only insure that critical results are provided at appropriate points in the development cycle. Communication by one group to the other during an activity might be seen as only minimally necessary. In collaboration, there is a sense that each group can learn something about its own methods and processes through a close partnership with the other.

(Adrienne Rich) In today's world of global connections Adrienne Rich's poem 'Our Whole Life a Translation' can be seen not simply as a beautiful metaphor for the untranslatability of human experience but very much as a reality for many women who live mobilities. If 'our whole life is a translation', we cannot help wondering: what then is the original? Is it another text, another experience or another reality? Many years ago Walter Benjamin defined translation as 'a mode', i.e. simultaneously a condition and a form of movement between texts and cultures, reminding his readers that 'a translation issues from the origi-nal' and 'it comes later than the original' (1999: 72). Therefore translation is not simply a linguistic movement of words and texts from one language into another but a move-ment of selves in\/through language to other places, cultures, selves and positions \u2013 a signal of dynamic processes of continuation, change and transformation. By employing the whole gamut of ambiguity in the concept of 'translation', this spe-cial issue of the European Journal of Women's Studies explores the complex connections between words and worlds, between self and Other(s), between the translating subject and the object\/context of translation from a gendered point of view. At the same time, the lens of translation offers alternative modes and scenarios for interpreting women's lives and identities \u2013 from the quotidian aspects of living, education and work to the more exceptional aspects of female creativity, subjectivity and expression in another language. The articles that follow raise multiple important and provocative questions: What does it mean to live in translation? How is femininity constructed, deconstructed, and recon-structed when transmitted from one language\/culture to another? Is stereotypical understanding of femininity\/masculinity reinforced or obliterated in the movement from one historical and social context to another? How do gender binaries and hierarchies Editorial by guest on January 12, 2016 ejw.sagepub.com Downloaded from 332 European Journal of Women's Studies 18(4) travel in translation and what effects do they have on the translation process? And vice versa \u2013 how is gender reconfigured in the movement from one linguistic and cultural environment to another? What strategies can make women more visible in\/through translation? Of course, many similar questions have been raised previously by scholars in wom-en's studies, translation studies as well as in other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. In the last three decades translation studies as an 'interdiscipline' (Snell-Hornby, 2006: 72) has moved away from the linguistic aspects of translation as text-based towards translation as culture and politics, exploring the role of various social categories in translation such as gender, ethnicity, class, ideology, history and tradition. It has drawn insights from sociology, anthropology, literary and postcolonial theory, cul-tural studies, philosophy, psychology and many other areas. For example, postcolonial scholars have shown how translation practices are always embedded in structures of power and knowledge, often imposing particular values and norms or masking inequali-ties (Bhabha, 1994; Rodriguez, 2008; Spivak, 1992). Along similar lines Lawrence Venuti equates these processes with doing violence: The violence of translation resides in its very purpose and activity: the reconstruction of the foreign text in accordance with values, beliefs, and representations that pre-exist in the target language, always configured in hierarchies of dominance and marginality, always determining the production, circulation, and reception of texts. (Venuti, 1996: 196).","462":"Understanding Collapse explores the collapse of ancient civilisations, such as the Roman Empire, the Maya, and Easter Island. In this lively survey, Guy D. Middleton critically examines our ideas about collapse - how we explain it and how we have constructed potentially misleading myths around collapses - showing how and why collapse of societies was a much more complex phenomenon than is often admitted. Rather than positing a single explanatory model of collapse - economic, social, or environmental - Middleton gives full consideration to the overlooked resilience in communities of ancient peoples and the choices that they made. He offers a fresh interpretation of collapse that will be accessible to both students and scholars. The book is an engaging, introductory-level survey of collapse in the archaeology\/history literature, which will be ideal for use in courses on the collapse of civilizations, sustainability, and climate change. It includes up-to-date case studies of famous and less well-known examples of collapses, and is illustrated with 25 black and white illustrations, 3 line drawings, 16 tables and 18 maps.\n\nReviews\n'Middleton\u2019s book is the best introduction to 'collapsology'.

This engaging, accessible, and comprehensively researched book offers no monolithic explanation for past crises of governance but astutely assesses human socio-ecological interactions in a wide range of archaic states and empires.

Discussions arising from the perspective\n\tof evolutionary biology have helped somewhat to clarify the problems\n\tsurrounding human creative activity. However, even the most advanced\n\tevolutionary treatments are unable to provide thorough explanations\n\tof creative activity or to deal productively with its effects on\n\tbehavior and society. Moreover, it appears that such explanations\n\twill not be forthcoming within the current evolutionary paradigm.\n\tOur purpose in this report is to present a potentially new evolutionary\n\tapproach to human creativity.We begin by introducing the concept\n\tof a system in which the components of individual cognition, including\n\tintelligence, learning, memory, personality and motivation interact\n\twith features of the sociocultural environment such as social stratification,\n\teducational policies and modes of communication to influence the\n\tcreative process, discovery and innovation. Implicit in this concept\n\tis the assertion that a productive characterization of the creative\n\tprocess cannot be stated solely by reference to a single level of\n\torganization. Empirical evidence corroborating this assertion is\n\texamined.Our system concept is then integrated with current theories\n\tof biocultural dynamics, leading to the hypothesis that creative\n\tactivity is an evolved strategy in which rules of cognitive development\n\tact through the joint inheritance of genetic and cultural information.\n\tData from cognitive science, social anthropology and behavior genetics,\n\ttesting the hypothesis of genetic involvement in creative development,\n\tare presented and discussed. Building on previous investigations,\n\twe suggest that creative potential in particular problem domains\n\trelates to the organization of semantic networks through the forging\n\tof links among previously dissociated elements. Formalization of\n\tthis linking thesis in turn generates several quantitative predictions\n\tabout domain specificity, the relationship between creative potential\n\tand age, environmental complexity, and various aspects of the sociocultural\n\tenvironment.A central problem in our theory of discovery and innovation\n\tis how creative activity is instantiated in the functional architecture\n\tof the brain. We develop a model in which creative activity is related\n\tto the patterns of activation among collections of neurons that are\n\tinnately predisposed to respond to particular patterns of electrochemical\n\texcitation. In this formulation, the creative process -- manifested\n\tat the cognitive level by the establishment of new linkages among\n\tnodes in the existing knowledge structure -- arises as a consequence\n\tof the elaboration of a novel sequence of group selection events.\n\tThe model is found to generate a number of testable predictions concerning,\n\tfor example, the relationship between creative potential and temporal\n\tenvironmental heterogeneity. Moreover, it appears to offer an explanation\n\tfor such individual characteristics as the domain-specificity of\n\tcreative potential. A particularly intriguing prediction arising\n\tfrom the model is that above some basal level of sensorimotor activity,\n\tcreativity may well be independent of the primary information transduction\n\tcapacities of the organism.The concluding sections of the report\n\tdevelop two related themes. First, we suggest that current mathematical\n\tmodels of cultural change and gene-culture coevolution have difficulty\n\tdealing with intervals of history containing successive innovations.\n\tIn the existing formulations, creative potentials, innovation rates,\n\tetc. are likely to enter as extrinsic parameters or driving forces\n\tsimilar to mutation rates, rather than as causal outcomes of developmental\n\tand behavioral events within the system. This limits their usefulness\n\tin applications to culturally transmitted novelty. However, it is\n\tpossible at least to begin construction of improved formal frameworks,\n\tthe so-called superspace theories, which can better accomodate unforeseen\n\tdiscoveries and their consequences. This step makes possible improved\n\tmacroevolutionary treatments of social change. Second, we consider\n\tin some detail the possibility that the formidable problems posed\n\tby creative diversity can be surmounted or at least eased. Our analysis\n\tsuggests that all types of creative products may well be accommodated\n\twithin a single multidimensional space of basic properties, with\n\tindividual elements differing according to the particulars of their\n\tassociated symbol systems and sustaining cognitive processes. Some\n\ttentative taxonomic principles are developed and applied. Preliminary\n\tevaluation of these classifications suggests that human creativity\n\twill be further clarified by the continued synthesis of evolutionary\n\tbiology with the cognitive sciences.","465":"In ihrer mittlerweile klassisch gewordenen Arbeit haben Peter L.

We now realize that reconstructing why unique human attributes evolved requires an understanding of our starting point, but this is a relatively recent perspective. One hundred years ago, the question of human origins was identical to that of hominin origins. Accepting Australopithecus into human ancestry, coupled with the modern synthesis of evolution, led anthropologists to consider humans as products of natural selection. They realized that increased intelligence did not initially distinguish our lineage, and that early hominins were apelike in many ways. Australopithecus brought bipedality, and brain expansion came with Homo. Because the human mind and behavior are products of evolution, we must reconstruct the selective pressures that shaped our lineage in order to understand ourselves today. Paleoanthropology, as with all anthropology, is becoming ever more question oriented, drawing on many areas of inquiry.","477":"Anthropometry is the science of obtaining systematic measurements of the human body. Anthropometry first developed in the 19th century as a method employed by physical anthropologists for the study of human variation and evolution in both living and extinct populations. Specifically, anthropomorphic measurements involve the size e.g., height, weight, surface area, and volume , structure e.g., sitting vs. standing height, shoulder and hip width, arm leg length, and neck circumference , and composition e.g., percentage of body fat, water content, and lean body mass of humans. Anthropometric measurements have been used historically as a means to associate racial, cultural, and psychological attributes with physical properties. The historical use of anthropometry has been applied to a wide range of applications, including Palaeoanthropology and human evolution, Biological anthropology, Craniometry and craniofacial attributes, Phylogeography, Criminology and Forensics, Phrenology, Physiognomy, Personality and mental typology. In ancient Anthropometry ie in PramanaSharir, the overall measurements were done in Swa AngulaPramana. Our Seers explained the concept of Swa AngulaPramana. It can be ideal parameter irrespective of sex, race and place. The concept of PramanaSharir in Ayurveda is unique.

And, following the metaphor a step further, it assumes the existence of a stable, well organized community with a shared set of values that is ready to embark upon a such construction project.\r\n\r\nI don't believe these assumptions hold up. To me, the state of interaction design feels more primitive. Rather than being an organized community, interaction design feels closer to being composed of a number of roving tribes who occasionally enounter one another, warily engage, and, finding the engagements stimulating, remain open to other encounters.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, how do we make progress? I suggest that rather than trying to construct a unified, coherent account of interaction design, we would do better to take a more syncretic approach, gathering appropriate concepts and exploring their interplay without, however, insisting on resolving their tensions and contradictions.\r\n\r\nIn this essay I explore these issues. I begin with a definition, and illustrate my approach to partitioning the terrain of interaction design using five conceptual \"lenses.\" In so doing, I cover most of what I see as the theoretical roots of interaction design.

Voici les nombreuses interrogations, parmi tant d'autres, auxquelles ce livre se propose d'apporter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9ponse. La raret\u00e9 des ouvrages en langue francaise portant sur les rapports entre sciences contemporaines et moralit\u00e9 humaine le rend particuli\u00e8rement utile.\n\nTable des mati\u00e8res.\n\npage 11 \/ \nLuc Faucher : Pr\u00e9face\n\npage 35 \/ \nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Ravat : Introduction\n\npage 47 \/ \nPremi\u00e8re partie.

Only some of these fires were the usual summer fires. Between 1911 and 1916, the colonial state had reclassified nearly 80 percent of Kumaon's forests into reserves. Villagers found that they had limited or no rights left in the reserves. In response they set fires in the newly classified reserves in a vivid spectacle of challenge to new forms of government over nature. Official reports and surviving accounts of villagers' actions suggest that many fires were deliberate protests against state interventions.\"","485":null,"486":"Faksimile unkommentiert.\r\n\r\nWichtig die Zitate aus dem Pr\ufffdface.Table des articles de voyages danach nicht paginiert.Nach Le Gentil 1954 'la cause indirecte des voyages de Cook' (155).\r\n\r\nLIVRE I (bis Seite 81):\r\nGr\u00f6\\\"sse des Staates steht nicht im Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Bedeutung (6-7), Ph\u00f6nizien und Karthago als Beispiel.Terres australes als contrebalance - gleichm\u00e4\\\"ssie Verteilung von Erde und Wasser (14-15).Beispiel Spanien 17-18, Holland (18), Paraguay (18)Bezug auf Buch von Josias Child (\ufffdlivre si judicieux, si simple, si vrai, que le grand Colbert lui-m\ufffdme ... n'auroit rien dit de plus juste ni de mieux r\ufffdfl\ufffdchi.\ufffd(29). \u00dcBERPR\u00dcFEN!!!Kritk an Justiz.

who have grown tired of doomsday scenarios about the environment would do well to pick up a copy of Environmentality. This book, an engaging and groundbreaking investigation of environmental politics and how people come to care for the environment, while not a call to arms, signals that change may already be on the way.  Drawing upon extensive fieldwork and archival research of forest protection in forty villages of Kumaon in Northern India, Arun Agrawal, Associate Professor in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Michigan, traces how these rural communities came to be willing and active agents of decentralized environmental regulation and to embrace principles of forest conservation. He demonstrates that dispersing power, knowledge, and regulation?and thereby creating more ?intimate forms of regulation??can lead to changes in the way people understand their place and actions in relation to something that they define as ?the environment.? This shift toward localizing regulatory power, which is taking place in more than fifty countries by Agrawal?s count, is a message of hope for the environment and for humankind.  Agrawal?s thesis and approach are signaled by his carefully chosen title. \"Environmentality\" gestures at Foucault?s later work on governmentality, which aims to ?understand and describe how modern forms of power and regulation achieve their full effects not by forcing people toward state-mandated goals but by turning them into accomplices? (p. 217). ?Environmentality,? a term of Agrawal?s own invention, refers to the creation of environmental subjects along with the emergence of the ?environment? as a domain that requires regulation and protection.  The Kumaon region in the Himalayas is the site of the fabled Chipko movement, which began in 1973 when villagers organized for the restoration of forest rights and which quickly spread throughout India. Agrawal?s interest is not in the movement, however, but in an earlier historical development: the creation of village-level forest councils. An outgrowth of political negotiations following widespread and sometimes violent village uprisings in the 1920s against the British colonial state?s creation of forest reserves, the forest councils now number over 3,000 and constitute one of the earliest surviving attempts to secure public participation in the preservation of forests. In his detailed historical account of the events leading to the creation of the reserves by the colonial state during 1911?16, Agrawal describes the application of a ?new technology of government??policy tools for environmental management?to bring the forests under central control in order to sustain the supply of timber and its products, which by the second half of the nineteenth century had become an increasingly important source of state revenue. Initially, government technology to protect the forests relied solely upon the classification and use of statistics to characterize forests, thereby creating an environmental sphere as a ?domain fit for government.? The imposition of new rules rendered illegal many of the subsistence practices of shifting cultivators, graziers, villagers, and local merchants, and existing rules were enforced more strictly. The locals who relied on forests for their livelihoods perceived these policies as a denial of their rights, resulting in massive protest through the setting of fires. Even the village headman appointed by the colonial government, resisted cooperation with the regime.  The new technology of the forest councils had three important effects: first, the creation of decision-making within localities, which significantly increased local people?s power vis-\u00e0-vis the state; second, the creation of ?regulatory communities? within localities where social actions could take form; and three, the creation of ?environmental subjects??people who came to think in new ways about the importance of the environment to their lives. The achievements of the forest councils created to resolve this crisis, by Agrawal?s account, are most impressive:   Today decision makers within the community use their intimate knowledge about members of the community to ensure that power is wielded neither too forcefully nor too weakly. They don?t want to provoke protests or be rendered ineffective. Community regulation operates more constantly, consistently, effectively and transformatively on its objects: village residents. Regulation is more comprehensive but less costly, more modulated but less visible, more autonomous but more continuous, more precise, and perhaps, for that reason, more humane. (p. 93)   Among the achievements of this book are the interventions Agrawal makes in several long-standing scholarly debates. First, he marks new ground on the question of the degree to which colonial rule influenced how humans exploited natural resources, what is sometimes referred to as the ?great ecology and colonialism debate.? On the one side of the debate, represented by Indian historian Ramachandra Guha, are those who deem the centrally controlled forest reserve policies socially unjust; on the other side, represented by scholar Richard Grove and his colleagues, are those who emphasize the necessary role the forest reserve policy played in saving the forests. But for Agrawal, the most enduring and significant legacy of colonial intervention on the environment is the state?s deployment of statistics to create the very notion of the ?environment? and define its value. He points out that the numbers are not ?just a faithful representation of an underlying uncontested reality.? Rather, the choice of particular statistical methods and of the particular classification of timber and timber products depended upon ?political and economic choices about what to measure, how to measure it, how often to measure, and how to present and interpret the results? (p. 37). In this way, Agrawal shifts attention away from the nature of colonialism?s rupture with pre-colonial practices and to the continuity of the influence of colonialism?s ?technologies of government.? In the case of Kumaon, prior to the creation of the forest councils, the technologies of government were used to exercise control and ?govern from a distance.? Thereafter, a new technology of government was introduced that relied on localities as partners in successful regulation. Second, Agrawal resists the tendency to explain environmental attitudes, beliefs, and actions in terms of static social categories such as gender, caste, and wealth. Instead, he argues that the critical factor in variations among attitudes and practices is the individual?s social position and involvement within regulatory practices. Carefully laying out his interview data, Agrawal shows how variations in the forms of monitoring and enforcement across forest councils consistently produced variations in the willingness of the individual to participate in regulation?the villagers who participate more in monitoring, either through labor or money, also express the greatest interest in forest preservation.  Third, Agrawal encourages a reconsideration of the relationship between beliefs and practices. Against the common assumption that beliefs determine practice, Agrawal draws upon his data to show that it is often precisely the opposite: beliefs and knowledge are developed through practice. People come to act in response to a situation about which they often have little control. In experiencing that act and its outcome they often find that earlier beliefs were mistaken, and they change them. Agrawal writes: ?Environmental practice . . . is the key link between the regulatory rule that government is all about and the imaginations that characterize particular links? (p. 167). A key lesson of the Kumaon story is that policies that successfully promote environmental values are more likely to be prompted by concerns for the fair distribution of resources and the political recognition of a community than a concern for preservation, which is instead developed in the process of implementing those policies.  In the concluding chapter, Agrawal acknowledges scholarly contributions to environmental politics and so helps his readers to navigate the environmental studies literature. In his assessment, the fields of conservation biology, environmental anthropology, environmental ethics, environmental sociology, historical ecology, and social ecology are of little help, since their main purpose appears to be to convince mainstream historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists of the benefits to their disciplines of paying greater attention to the environment. Instead, he points to the cross-disciplinary fields of political ecology, scholarship on the commons, and feminist environmentalism as the most helpful in the direct attention they give to how institutions, politics, and identities affect environmental policy processes and outcomes. At the same time he highlights the shortcomings of these approaches in their failure to focus adequately on the changes in actions and beliefs of environmental subjects. Only feminist environmentalists (aside from scholars who focus on indigenous peoples) pay adequate attention to identity?with the drawback that their concern is strictly with gender.  Using carefully constructed arguments, Agrawal successfully achieves his purpose of creating a framework for environmental policy analysis. One only wishes the message was in a language and form that would easily draw in policy and advocacy readers, not just scholars. With all the talk of the ?death of environmentalism? within the American environmental movement these days, environmentalists would undoubtedly benefit from the important insights that Agrawal offers.  ?JOANNE BAUER, Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs","485":null,"486":null}}
